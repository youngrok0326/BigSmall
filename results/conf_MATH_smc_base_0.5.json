                    "completion": "1. Think: To determine which student has the greatest average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken for each student and then calculate their average speeds.\n\n2. The total distance for all students combined is the sum of the lengths of each student's path in the graph. From the graph, we can see that the total distance is 6 units.\n\n3. The total time for all students combined is the sum of the durations of each student's path in the graph. From the graph, we can see that the total time is 5 units.\n\n4. We can now calculate the average speed for each student. The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n\n5. For Evelyn, which has traveled a distance of 3 units in 3 units of time, the average speed is 3/3 = 1 unit per time unit.\n\n6. For Briana, which has traveled a distance of 2 units in 2 units of time, the average speed is 2/2 = 1 unit per time unit.\n\n7. For Carla, which has traveled a distance of 5 units in 2.2 units of time, the average speed is 5/2.2 \u2248 2.27 units per time unit.\n\n8. For Debra, which has traveled a distance of 1 unit in 1.4 units of time, the average speed is 1/1.4 \u2248 0.71 units per time unit.\n\n9. For Angela, which has traveled a distance of 4 units in 2 units of time, the average speed is 4/2 = 2 units per time unit.\n\n10. Therefore, Carla has the greatest average speed, which is approximately 2.27 units per time unit.\n<answer>\nCarla\n</answer>\nThe answer is: Carla",
