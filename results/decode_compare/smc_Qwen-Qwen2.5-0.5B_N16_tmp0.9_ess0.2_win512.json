Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  To convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radial distance $r$ and the angle $\\theta$ with respect to the positive horizontal axis. The formula for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates is given by: $$r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$ $$\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$$\nIn this case, the point $(0,3)$ corresponds to $x$-coordinate has a negative value, as we are moving down the number line\nStep 3: The original $y$-component has a negative value, as we are moving to the right of the number line\nStep 4: We can write the original point as $(0,3)$, because we know that a point's original $x$-coordinate is $0$\nStep 5: Let's find the x and y components of the new point $(0,3)$\nStep 6: $x=$original $x$ coordinate $\\times \\text{the negative sign}$\nStep 7: $3=$original $y$ component $\\times \\text{the negative sign}$\nStep 8: $=3x$ and $=-3y$\nStep 9: $=3x-y$\nStep 10: We can plug in the original value of $x$ and $y$ into this formula\nStep 11: $=0 \\times  (-3) -3 \\times 3 = 0 - 9 = -9$\nStep 12: We can now find the $r$ value using the point's original $x$ ($0$) and",
