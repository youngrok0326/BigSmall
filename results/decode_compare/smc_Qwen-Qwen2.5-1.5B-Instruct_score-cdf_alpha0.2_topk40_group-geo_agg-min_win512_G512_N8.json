          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of the double sum as the expressions are finite to $k$ numbers. So now, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.3. We now introduce $p_1$ to replace double sum of k: $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^2}$. Notice that $p_1$ is the second sum in the expression above.4. We can continue similarly the process to replace the double sum of j: $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+2k)^2}$.5. Now, by changing variables, we have $p_2$ and $q$ (more complex terms are summing a sequence of sums).{$\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+2k)^2} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$.6. The expression in the parentheses above resembles $p + q$ (the sum of the series above the sum). The triple sum in the expression can be proved as $q - p$.7. By combining all these results together, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = (p + q) - p = q$.8. The sum above equals the $q$ that we've defined in the original problem.Conclusion: The problem is to find a way to represent $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+ k)^3}$ with respect to sums $p$ and $q$. By using the pattern, you can check that if $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$, then $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+ k)^3} = q$. Therefore, the answer is $q$.",
