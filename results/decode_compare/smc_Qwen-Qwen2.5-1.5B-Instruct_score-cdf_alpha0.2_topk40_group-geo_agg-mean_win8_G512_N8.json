          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$$\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$\n   \n3. Within the double sum, we are left with a similar third degree sum,$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$4. Now, we interchange the order of summing (by Fubini's theorem) over $k$ because the function in the summand is non-negative. Additionally, it is bounded between 0 and 1, as $|1/(j+k)^3|\\leq 1/(j+k)^2$ for all $k$. So, we get $$\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$5. By separate the summing over $j=1$ and $j\\geq1$, we see that the original double sum is equal to $$\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = (\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3})\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + 1)^3}$$6. Let's replace $p$ for the first sum$$\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$7. The final step is replacing $k$ with $j-k$:$$\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = -\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + (j+1)^3)}$$8. Therefore, we get$$ \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{(j)=(j +1)^3}$$9. Hence, we get$$ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3}$$10. Finally, we pass the summing over $j$ to $C = q$. Therefore, we have$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}$$11. Therefore,$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = C$$12. Therefore,$$C = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}$$13. And finally,$$\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} = p$$To conclude,\n\\",
