          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, we have $j + (c-k) = c$. Now, integrate: \n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\,dk \\, dj = \\int \\int \\frac{1}{j^3(1 + \\frac{1}{c-j})^3} \\, dk \\, dj = \\int \\int \\frac{1}{j^3(1- \\frac{1}{c-j})^3} \\, dk \\, dj \\]3. For the $j$ integration, use the fact that $\\frac{1}{j^3} = \\int \\frac{1}{j^4} \\, dj$. Let \n\\[ A = \\int \\int \\frac{1}{j^{4}} \\, dj \\, dk \\]\n\\[ B = \\int \\int \\frac{1}{(c-j)^4} \\, dk \\, dj \\]4. Now, let's break the core part of the integral (the double integral) into two pieces that are easier to calculate by integrating first:\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{j^4} \\, dj \\, dk \\]\nAnd\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{(c-j)^4} \\, dk \\, dj \\]5. Now, integrate over the outer region ($c$):\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{j^4} \\, dj \\, dk \\]\nwas done earlier because the outer circle ($c$) integration will cancel out the inner circle ($k$). 6. For the second part, $B$, note that when $j = c$, we have $c - (c-k) = k$ and $k = c - (c-k)$. Thus:\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{(c-j)^4} \\, dk \\, dj = \\int \\int \\frac{1}{k^4} \\, dk \\, dj \\]7. Next, integrate over the inner region ($c$).\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{k^4} \\, dk \\, dj = \\int \\int \\frac{1}{k^5} \\, dk \\, dj \\]8. Compare the expression to the original integral:\n\\[ = \\int \\int \\frac{1}{k^5} \\, dk \\, dj \\]9. From step 8, notice that when $k = c$, we have $c - (c-k) = k$. This means we can combine the middle steps.Therefore,\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{k^5} \\, dk \\, dj \\]\nequals\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{(c-j)^5} \\, dk \\, dj \\]10. Now, factor out the circle: \n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{((j+c)^2 - c)^5} \\, dk \\, dj \\]11. Simplify and substitute:\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{1}{(c-j)^5} \\, dk \\, dj \\]Finally, compare the expression back to the original integral, and the triangle head (+) in place of addition.Therefore,\n\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(c-j)^3} \\]12. When $j = c$, we have \n\\[ \\frac{1}{(c-j)^3} = \\frac{1}{k^3} \\]13. Substitute into the original:\n\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} (p + q) \\]14. Thus, the coefficient of $p$ is 1/2 and the coefficient of $q$ is 1.Therefore, adding the coefficients accordingly and getting the final answer:Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{p+q}{2}}$.",
