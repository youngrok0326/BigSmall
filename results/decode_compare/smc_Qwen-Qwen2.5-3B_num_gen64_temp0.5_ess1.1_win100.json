Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of $r$ and $\\theta$. The polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ are related to the rectangular coordinates $(x,y)$ by the following equations:\n$$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$$\nIn this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$. Plugging these values into the equations, we get:\n$$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$$\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$$\nSince the tangent of $\\frac{3}{0}$ is undefined, we need to consider the special case where $x = 0$ and $y > 0$. In this case, the angle $\\theta$ is equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, because the point lies on the positive $y$-axis. Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n</think>\n2. <answer>\n$(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$\n</answer>",
