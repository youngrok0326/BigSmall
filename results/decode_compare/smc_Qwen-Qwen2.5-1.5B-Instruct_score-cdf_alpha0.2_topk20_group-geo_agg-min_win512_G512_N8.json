          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of the double sum and the infinite series. This will allow us to iteratively cancel out terms in the inner sum:\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\right) = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\right) $$3. Letting $c = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}$, we can rewrite the second difference as $c$. Thus, further simplifying gives us:\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{c}{(k + 1)^3}$$4. We can now rearrange the expression by considering a new variable $m = k + 1$. This allows us to remove the sum over $k$:\n$$\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty\\frac{c}{m^3} = c\\left(\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{m^3}\\right)$$5. We already know that $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} = c$, so we can substitute this into the expression above to solve for $c$:\n$$q = c \\cdot \\frac{\\zeta(3) - 1}{2}$$6. Substituting this expression into the original double sum, we are left with:\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty\\frac{c}{m^3}$$7. Using the previously established value of $c$, we substitute and rewrite as:\n$$\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty\\frac{c}{m^3} = \\frac{c}{\\zeta(3)}\\left(\\frac{\\pi^3}{16}\\right) - \\frac{c}{2}$$8. Rearranging gives us:\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\zeta(3) - 1}{2\\zeta(3)}c$$9. Substituting the value of $c$, we get:\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{c}{2}$$10. Since $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$, we can write $c$ as:\n$$c = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2} = p$$11. Plugging this into the expression, we get:\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}p$$12. Therefore, the final answer is:\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}p}$$",
