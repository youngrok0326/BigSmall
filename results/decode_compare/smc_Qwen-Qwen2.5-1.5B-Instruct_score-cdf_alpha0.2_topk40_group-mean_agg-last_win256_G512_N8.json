For each $j$, consider the sum of $\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}$ for all $k$ from 1 to infinity. This is a double sum, but we will focus on how it relates to $p$.Step 2: For each fixed $j$, we have a sum of $\\frac{1}{k^2}$ for $k$ from 1 to $j$, plus a sum that includes terms from $k = j + 1$ to infinity. We can express this relationship using $p$ by noting that the sum of $\\frac{1}{k^2}$ includes the first $j$ terms plus the tail of the series, which relates directly to the tail of the series starting from $k = j + 1$.Step 3: Therefore, the inner sum is a part of the tail of the series starting from $k = j + 1$, so we can express the value of the double sum in terms of $p$.Step 4: Similarly, the sum of $\\frac{1}{k^3}$ includes the first $j$ terms plus the tail of the series, which relates directly to the tail of the series starting from $k = j + 1$. Step 5: After determining that each term is a part of the tail of a series starting from $k = j + 1$, we can express the double sum in terms of $p$ and $q$.Step 6: Finally, we substitute the expressions into the double sum and simplify to get the final answer in terms of $p$ and $q$, as follows:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} &= \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} \\left( \\sum_{k = 1}^j \\frac{1}{k^2} \\right) + \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} \\left( \\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} \\sum_{k = 1}^j \\frac{1}{k^2} + \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} \\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\\\\n&= pq + \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} \\left( \\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= pq + \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} \\left( \\frac{1}{k^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= pq + \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty \\frac{q}{k} \\left( \\sum_{r = 1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{(r + 1)^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= pq + \\frac{q}{k} \\left( \\sum_{r = 1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{(r + 1)^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= pq + \\frac{q}{k} \\left( \\sum_{r = 1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{r^3} - \\frac{1}{(k + 1)^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= pq + \\frac{q}{k} \\left( p - \\frac{1}{(k + 1)^3} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{pq + \\frac{q}{k} \\left( p - \\frac{1}{(k + 1)^3} \\right)}.\n\\end{align*}",
