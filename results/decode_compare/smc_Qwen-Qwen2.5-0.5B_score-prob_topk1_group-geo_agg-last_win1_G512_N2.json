          "answer": "9",
          "completion": "Assistant: Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step using Python code to find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196.First, we need to find the prime factors of 196. The prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n\\[ 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\]\n\\[ 7 \\div 7 = 1 \\]So the prime factors of 196 are \\( 2, 2, 7 \\). A divisor of 196 can be expressed as \\( 2^x \\times 3^y \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are whole numbers.To find the number of divisors of 196, we use the formula for finding the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization. If the prime factorization is \\( p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^{a_n} \\), there are \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_n + 1) \\) divisors.Let's calculate the number of divisors of 196. The number 196 is \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\), so its prime factorization is \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\).Using the formula for finding the number of divisors, we get:\n\\[ (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]Therefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.Assistant: Thank you for providing the prime factorization of 196 and the number of divisors.
