We can interchange the order of summation since the sum is over all positive integers $j$ and $k$. So we get, $ = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j+k}$. 3. Now we can rewrite the inner sum as $ = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\sum_{k = j}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j+k}\\right) = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+j+1}$. 4.

We can further simplify the inner sum by substituting, $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+j+k} = \\frac{1}{1+j}\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{1+k}$.6.
