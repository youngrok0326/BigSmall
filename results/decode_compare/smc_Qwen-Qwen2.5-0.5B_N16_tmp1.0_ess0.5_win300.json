Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 6\nExplanation\nStep 1: To convert the point $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates, you need to use these formulas:\n$r = \\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}} => r = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (3)^2}$\nStep 2: Solve to get $r = \\sqrt{3 ^ {2} + 3^ {2} } = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate $\\theta$, so smart! To convert the point (0, 3) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. The formula for the x^2 + 3^2\nr = 3\n\nStep 4:\nStep Definition:\ntheta = angle at the origin that connects the center of x and, solving once we get theta:\n\\\\",
