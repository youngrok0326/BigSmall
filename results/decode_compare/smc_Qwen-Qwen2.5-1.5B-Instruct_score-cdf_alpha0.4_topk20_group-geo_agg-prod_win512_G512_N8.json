For $r$, since $x = 0$, we know we're on the y-axis. So we calculate $r$:\\[r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\\]For $\\theta$, since $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, we know we're on the positive y-axis. We can use the formula for $\\theta$ to find out how many radians or degrees the point is from the start:\\[\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)\\]Since the point is directly up and to the left, $\\theta$ equals $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians:\\[\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\]So, the polar coordinates for the point $(0, 3)$ are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. Therefore, the final answer is $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",
