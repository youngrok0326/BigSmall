Express your answer as a common fraction.\nSolution: 1. Given that $f(x) = \\frac{3x-2}{x-2}$, we want to find the value of $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0)$.\n2. To find $f(-2)$, we substitute $x=-2$ into the expression for $f(x)$; therefore $f(-2)=\\frac{3(-2)-2}{-2-2}=-5$.\n3. To find $f(-2) = (3(-2)-2)/((-2)-2) = (-6-2)/(-4) = -8/(-4) = 2 Step 5: f(-1) = (3(-1)-2)/((-1)-2) = (-3-2)/(-1-2 / 1 = -2.\n8. Now, let's find the expression for $f(-1)$.\n   $f(-1) = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-1}$\n   Simplify the expression for $f(-1)$.\n   $f(-1) = \\frac{-5}{-1}$\n   $f(-1) = 5$\n\nStep 3: Step 3: Evaluate $f(0)$.\n   Replace $x$ with $0$ in the given function.\n   a * (-2) + c = -5\n$$\n$$\n  -2a + c = -5\n$$\n8.
