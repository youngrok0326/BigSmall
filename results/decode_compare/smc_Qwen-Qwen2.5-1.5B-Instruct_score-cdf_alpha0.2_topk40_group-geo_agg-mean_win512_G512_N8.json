          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can utilize the formula for the sum of a series of reciprocals of the reciprocals of the terms of a sequence. Thus, we have $p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$. 3. Let's call the reciprocal of $p$ as $q$ for easier identification. Therefore, we have $\\frac{1}{p} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$. 4. Now let's consider the form of the term $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. When we expand this term, we get $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{(j+k)(j+k)(j+k)}$.5. To simplify the calculation of the series, we can factor a $-1$ from the numerator and write the series accordingly. We have $\\frac{1}{(j+k)} = \\frac{1}{-1(j+k)}$. 6. This allows us to combine the previous term $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ into $\\frac{1}{(j+k)(j+k)(j+k)}$ and factor it out, giving us $- \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$, where $- \\cdot$ represents the reciprocal of the term.7. Therefore, we rewrite the series we need to find in terms of the reciprocals of the series we already have. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = -\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 8. Accepting the conditions, and keeping in mind the original series form from 2, we get $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = -\\frac{1}{p^2}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$.9. Taking the reciprocal of the series on the right side, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = -\\frac{1}{q}$. 10. We already defined $p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$, so $p^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}\\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^4}$.11. Thus, from 10, $p^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^4}$ is equal to  $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^4}$. 12. To simplify further, we can see from this $p^2$ that the given expression is $\\frac{1}{q}$. 13. Since the given series involves the term $- \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$, by reversing the order of addition, we can arrive at the final expression by dividing $p$ by $q$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{p}{q}}$.",
