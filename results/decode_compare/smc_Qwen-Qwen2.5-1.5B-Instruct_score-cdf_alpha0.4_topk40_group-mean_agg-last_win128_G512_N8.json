For $x > 0$, the angle is on the positive x-axis ($\\theta = 0$). For $x < 0$, the angle is on the negative x-axis. When $x = 0$, it is on the y-axis, and whatever direction it's pointing into means the angle is exactly on the y-axis.2. $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$For division, recall that division is the same as doing the operation but multiplying by the reciprocal.- When $x = 0$, $\\theta$ is undefined because division by zero is not possible. However, the absolute value of the angle $| \\arctan(3) |$ is the angle needed.Therefore, the angle $\\theta$ is:- When $x = 0$ and $y > 0$, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n- When $x = 0$ and $y < 0$, $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.Since we are not given any additional information that would indicate whether $0 < x < 0$ or $0 > x$ in relation to $y$, we assume the common case: $x = 0$ and $y > 0$, so $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.Since $r = 3$ is positive and the general idea of $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi$ should be relevant here, the angle $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is within the range, makes sense in both directions.Therefore, the final answer is $r = 3$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.$\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$",

We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$$\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1,j \\neq l}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$$by manipulating separetly first summand and second one.3. The desired terms are expressed as: \n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1,j \\neq l}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}=p-q+c $$4. Therefore, \n$$c = p-q$$5. Substitute the values of $p$ and $q$.6. Here, we find that by using $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}$, the answer is found to be $c = \\frac{p}{q} - p + q$.7. Substituting this into the double sum gives a compact form ($p = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^2}$):$$\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p\\frac{q}{p}-p+q$$Conclusion: If you are fortunate to have $p$ and $q$ for given problem, you can find the answer by setting $a = \\frac{q}{p}$.`Therefore, the final answer is: $\\frac{p q}{p}-p+q$ `",
