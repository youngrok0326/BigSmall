Plugging in the values of x and y, we get:\n$r = \\sqrt{ 0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$Step 2: Calculate the angle (dtheta)/3, where theta represents the angle from the x-axis to the line connecting the origin and the point.\n----------------------------Our next step is to find the angle (theta) between the x-axis and the point, represented by (0,3).\nAs the problem doesn't specify the direction of rotation for the point, we'll assume it's counterclockwise from the y-axis. However, since both x and y are positive, the angle formed between the lines becomes positive. Thus, theta = 0.Step 3: Calculate the angle (dtheta)/3\n----------------Next, we'll need to calculate this angle step by step:$r = 3$\n$\\theta = 0$Step 4: Convert theta into decimal form\n------------------------------To convert $\\theta = 0\\degree$, we can use the inverse tangent function, $\\arctan(\\theta)$:$\\arctan(0) = 0$Now we have the angle in radians, and we can now move on to the conversion to polar form:$r = 3$\n$\\theta = 0$Step 5: Convert theta into polar form\n------------------------------Putting it all together:$r = 3$\n$\\theta = 0$Therefore, the polar coordinates representing the point (0,3) are (3, 0 degrees), which means the point is 3 units away from the origin along a line forming a 90-degree angle with the positive y-axis, and it's located 0 units along the x-axis.So, the final answer is (3, 0).\nAGMA\nConvert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
