          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$$ =\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} .$$3. The number of terms in the double sum is $k(k+1)$, as explained in the binomial coefficient formula. The $k$ runs from $1$ to $\\infty$ and $j$ runs from $1$ to $\\infty$. Thus, we can telescope the sum:$$ =\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} - \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{2}{j^3} + \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{3}{j^3} - \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{4}{j^3} + \\ldots $$4. Notice that the series on is telescoping and can be simplified further:$$ = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{j^3} - \\frac{2}{j^3} + \\frac{3}{j^3} - \\frac{4}{j^3} + \\ldots\\right) $$5. We can factor out the common term $\\frac{1}{j^3}$, observing that two odd terms cancel out:$$ = \\frac{1}{1^3} - \\frac{2}{1^3} + \\frac{3}{2^3} - \\frac{4}{2^3} + \\frac{5}{3^3} - \\frac{6}{3^3} + \\ldots $$6. This can be written as:\n$$ = 1 - \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{(2k-1)^3} $$7. Here, notice that we have $n$ terms and we start from $2k-1$ (because we want all the odd numbers, start with 1, then 3, 5, 7, etc. ).8. The $\\frac{1}{(2k-1)^3}$ part is $q$ since we summed the cubes termwise over the odd numbers from 1 to $\\infty$, but we can rewrite it as $\\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{j^3} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{2}{j^3} + \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{3}{j^3} - \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{4}{j^3} + \\ldots$ and so on.9. Now, we can use the 2-step sum rule to find $q$:$$ q = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{2}{j^3}\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{3}{j^3}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{4}{j^3}\\right) + \\ldots $$10. We can see that:$$ q = p - 2\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(2j)^3} $$11. Substituting back, we can now find $p$:$$ 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1^3} - \\frac{2}{1^3} + \\frac{3}{2^3} - \\frac{4}{2^3} + \\ldots \\right)p = 1 - q $$12. We substitute $q$ back in to find $p$ in terms of $q$:$$ p = 1 - q$$Therefore, the final answer is:$\\boxed{p - q}$.",
