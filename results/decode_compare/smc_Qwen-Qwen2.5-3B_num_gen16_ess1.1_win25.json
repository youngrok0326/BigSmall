Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius (r) and the angle (\u03b8) of the point. The radius (r) is the distance from the origin to the point, and the angle (\u03b8) is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.\n2. <think>\nThe formula to find the radius (r) is given by:\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\nwhere x and y are the rectangular coordinates of the point.\n3. <think>\nIn this problem, the rectangular coordinates are (0, 3). So, we can substitute x = 0 and y = 3 into the formula to find the radius (r):\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n4. <think>\nNow, we need to find the angle (\u03b8). The formula to find the angle (\u03b8) is given by:\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\nwhere x and y are the",

Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. From the graph, we can see that the distance traveled by each student is represented by the vertical lines, and the time taken is represented by the horizontal lines.\n\nFor Evelyn, the distance traveled is 4.5 units, and the time taken is 1.25 units. So, her average speed is 4.5 / 1.25 = 3.6 units per unit of time.\n\nFor Briana, the distance traveled is 2.2 units, and the time taken is 2.5 units. So, her average speed is 2.2 / 2.5 = 0.88 units per unit of time.\n\nFor Carla, the distance traveled is 5.2 units, and the time taken is 4.25 units. So, her average speed is 5.2 / 4.25 = 1.22 units per unit of time.\n\nFor Debra, the distance traveled is 2.8 units, and the time taken is 5.6 units. So, her average speed is 2.8 / 5.6 = 0.5 units per unit of time.\n\nFor Angela, the distance traveled is 1.4 units, and the time taken is 6.8 units.
