          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:   \\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = -(p + 1). \\]\n   \n   This step involves recognizing the series can be rearranged to take out the common term and use the fact that $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ appears in both terms for $j$ and $k$, leading to a simplified expression.3. Then, we take the double sum and rearrange it according to the equation:   \\[\\left(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k^3)^2}.\\]   In this step, we focus on the original double sum and recognize that it can be reorganized to isolate the individual terms, leading to a more manageable expression.4. We now take the double sum again, and this time,\\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k^3)^2} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^6} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k)^6} < \\frac{1}{k^5}\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^5} = \\frac{1}{p} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{p}{4}.\\]\n   \n   This step involves recognizing a new double sum and applying the known result that the series diverges to infinity. A common mistake could be to overlook the fact that $\\frac{1}{k^6}$ diverges, leading to the change in the approach.5. In the final sum, we express it as:   \\[\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k^3)^2} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k)^6}.\\]   This step involves recognizing the series and reorganizing it into a more familiar form, leading to the conclusion that the sum is $\\frac{1}{p}$ times a known divergent series.6. By combining the results from steps 2 and 4, the original double sum simplifies to:   \\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} + (p + 1) = -c + p + (p + 1).\\]   This step involves combining the simplified expressions from steps 2 and 4, leading to the final expression.7. Expressing the final results in terms of $p$ and $q$, we obtain:   \\[p + 1 - \\frac{p}{4} - 1 = \\frac{3p}{4}.\\]   This step involves substituting the known definitions of $p$ and $q$ and simplifying the expression to obtain the final answer in terms of $p$ and $q$.Therefore, the sum can be expressed in terms of $p$ as:\\[\\boxed{\\frac{3p}{4}}.\\]",
