So substitute with\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]2. **Corresponding Angle $\\theta$**:\n   From the equation $(x,y)$ multiplied by $r$, the angle $\\theta$ is where the line $x$, $y$ intersects with the x-axis. This is \n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\arctan \\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n   \\]\n   With $(x, y)$ being $(0, 3)$, the angle\n   \\[\n   \\arctan \\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n   \\]\n   Specifically, the angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the positive side of the x-axis and the positive y-axis, with respect to the line from the origin to the point $(0,3)$.3. **Verification**:\n   Using the angle $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to verify the given solution, let's see if it satisfies $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$,\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\implies r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2}\n   \\]\n   Since,\n   \\[\n   r = 3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the point $(0,3)$ is indeed $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ in polar coordinates.**Conclusion**:\nHence, the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates is represented in polar coordinates as $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.

We can use the term-by-term integration for calculating the infinite sum.Step 2: Similarly, we can write an expression for $\\sum_{j = 1, \\, k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$. Here, we also use the term-by-term integration method.Step 3: Now, we can combine the above two expressions and express it in terms of $p$ and $q$.Let's start with the inner sum:$\\sum_{j = 1, \\, k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$This is because when we fix $k$, we are integrating over $j$ instead of $j + k$. We can use the term-by-term integration method here as well. We can write the following expression:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\int_0^1 (1 - x)^3 \\, dx$This is because when we integrate over $j$, we are essentially summing up the terms for each fixed value of $j$.Step 4: Now, we can substitute the value of the inner sum into the outer sum:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\int_0^1 (1 - x)^3 \\, dx$Step 5: The integral can be evaluated as follows:$\\int_0^1 (1 - x)^3 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{4} (1 - x)^4 \\bigg|_0^1 = \\frac{1}{4}$Step 6: Therefore, we can simplify the expression further:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$Step 7: Now we can simplify the sum further:Since $p$ is defined as a sum $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$, we can write:$\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} = \\frac{1}{p}$Therefore, the expression can be simplified to:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{4p}$Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4p}}$.",
