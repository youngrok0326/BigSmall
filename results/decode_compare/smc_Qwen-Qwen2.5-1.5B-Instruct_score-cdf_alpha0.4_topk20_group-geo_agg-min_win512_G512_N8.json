This is potentially a Bernoulli summation or a hypergeometric representation. However, this integral is not directly solvable without more specialized techniques. Let's re-evaluate the problem.4. Alternatively, since we have the parity of the summation (i.e., $j + k = c$), there exists a relationship between $p$ and $q$ through the second parity (i.e., $i+j = m$). 5. Here, we use that the sum of the series is always even. 6. Therefore, one can write a nice final expression, with $p$ and $q$,\n\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p \\times \\frac{1}{1-q} \\]7. Furthermore, $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^n}$ is well-known and can be represented as $\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{n}}$ for all $n>1$. 8. By substituting the value of $q$ into the original $p$ and subtracting 1, we find that the sum of the series equals $\\frac{p}{1 - q}$. 9.
