Let's first calculate $r$:\\[ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\]Next, we calculate $\\theta$.

However, for the purpose of this exercise, we are specifically looking for the $\\arctan$ value that gives the correct angle in the full circle from 0 to $2\\pi$ for polar coordinates.Since $x = 0$, $y > 0$, the angle $\\theta$ in the first and third quadrants is:\\[ \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\]This value is chosen because the point $(0, 3)$ is on the positive y-axis, which is equivalent to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

The term \\(\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) is symmetric in \\(j\\) and \\(k\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the double sum as:\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\]\\[ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\]Next, we change the index of summation in the inner sum. Let \\(m = j + k\\). Then \\(j = m - k\\), and as \\(j\\) ranges from 1 to \\(\\infty\\), \\(k\\) ranges from 1 to \\(\\infty\\) as well. Therefore, we rewrite the inner sum as:\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\]\\[ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{m=k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\]Notice that the inner sum is taken over \\(m\\) starting from \\(k\\) to \\(\\infty\\). Since \\(k\\) is a constant, the inner sum can be simplified to:\\[ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{m=2+k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\]This simplifies the double sum to:\\[ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{m=2+k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\]Now, we can separate the outer sum:\\[ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2+k)^3} \\sum_{m=2+k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\]The inner sum is still a sum over all \\(m\\), but it is now over \\(m\\) starting from 2+k:\\[ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2+k)^3} \\sum_{m=2+k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\]Notice that this inner sum is just \\(q\\):\\[ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2+k)^3} q \\]Now, we can change the index again to \\(j = 2 + k\\), so \\(k = j - 2\\):\\[ = \\sum_{j=3}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} q \\]Finally, we recognize that the remaining double sum \\(\\sum_{j=3}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\) is a part of \\(q\\):\\[ = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} q \\]Therefore, we can express the original sum in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\):\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} q \\]\\[ = q \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} \\]\\[ = q \\cdot \\zeta(3) \\]However, we need to express it in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), so we use the fact that the series \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2} \\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\) is given by the product of the series \\(p\\) with itself in the context of the problem.
