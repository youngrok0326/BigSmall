We can change the order of summation. Instead of summing over \\(j\\) first and then over \\(k\\), we can sum over \\(k\\) first and then over \\(j\\). This transforms the sum into:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]Now, consider the inner sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\). We can use the series expansion for \\(\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) and consider the behavior of this sum as \\(k\\) becomes large.

This suggests that we can find a way to express the double sum using sums of the form \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\).We know that:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]By considering the symmetry and the behavior of the sum, we can use the fact that the sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) is approximately \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\) for large \\(k\\).

Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\approx \\frac{1}{k^3}. \\]This gives us:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k^3} = \\frac{\\zeta(3) \\zeta(3)}{2} = \\frac{(\\zeta(3))^2}{2}. \\]Since \\(\\zeta(3) = q\\), we have:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{",
