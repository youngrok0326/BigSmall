Let's denote the given sum by \\( S \\):\n\\[ S = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]\nWe can rewrite the sum by changing the order of summation. Notice that each term \\(\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) appears exactly once in the double sum for each pair \\((j, k)\\). To change the order of summation, we can introduce a new variable \\( n = j + k \\). For each fixed \\( n \\), \\( j \\) and \\( k \\) can take any values such that \\( j + k = n \\). This means \\( j \\) ranges from 1 to \\( n-1 \\), and \\( k \\) ranges from 1 to \\( n-1 \\). Thus, the sum can be rewritten as:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{n^3}. \\]\nThe inner sum is simply the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{n^3} \\) from \\( j = 1 \\) to \\( j = n-1 \\), which is \\( (n-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^3} \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty (n-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^3}. \\]\nWe can simplify this further:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{n-1}{n^3} \\right) = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right). \\]\nThis can be split into two separate sums:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}. \\]\nWe recognize that the first sum is \\( p - 1 \\) (since \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p \\) and the first term \\( \\frac{1}{1^2} = 1 \\) is excluded), and the second sum is \\( q - 1 \\) (since \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q \\) and the first term \\( \\frac{1}{1^3} = 1 \\) is excluded). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ S = (p - ",
