          "completion": "1. First, we need to know what an inverse function is. An inverse function, denoted as $f^{-1}(x)$, effectively switches the roles of $x$ and $y$. To find $f^{-1}(x)$, we switch the roles of $x$ and $y$ in the equation $y = f(x)$ to solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:\\[\ny = \\frac{(3 - x) - 2}{x - 2}\n\\]2. Solving this equation, we find:\\[\ny = \\frac{3 - x - 2}{x - 2}\n\\]Let's rearrange terms to isolate $y$:\\[\ny(x - 2) = 3 - x - 2\n\\]\\[\ny(x - 2) = 1 - x\n\\]3. To solve for $x$, we get:\\[\ny = \\frac{x + 1}{y}\n\\]4. Solving for $y$:\\[\ny^2 = x + 1\n\\]\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} = -1 + 1\n\\]\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} = 0\n\\]5. Rearranging, we get:\\[\nx = -y\n\\]6.

Let's write six as one and five as six. There is four one, because one is two multiplied by two. There are two two, because two is three multiplied by three. So 56 is one multiplied by five one multiplied by six two multiplied by six three. All multiply together to get 196. Notice that 10 can be written as 1 + 0. So 196 can be written as 1 multiplied by 9 and 1 plus 0. So now we have put together two different basic multiplication tables. We have four, because four is one multiplied by six, six is two multiplied by three, three is three divided by two times four, and two is two multiplied by two. So six is the last number. But if we see the common factors, there is one and six, which is division by three. Therefore, the common factors of 196 are 1 and 2. So the greatest common factor of 196 is 2. We just take the greatest number that divides every number in the list, 2 is the best choice. And now we can write the answer as 2 is the greatest common factor.
