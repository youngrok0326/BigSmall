Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of r and theta. \n\nAssume the point is (x, y) = (0, 3). Here, x = r * cos(theta) and y = r * sin(theta). \n\nWe can find r by using the Pythagorean theorem: r = 7 and b = 10, find a^2 + b^2.\nSolution: <think>First, find a^2.  7^2 = 49. Next, find b^2.  10^2 = 100.
