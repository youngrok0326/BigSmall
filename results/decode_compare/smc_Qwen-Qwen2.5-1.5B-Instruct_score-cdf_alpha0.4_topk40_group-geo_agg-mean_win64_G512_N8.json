Using the first formula:\\[r = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\\]For the second formula, since $x = 0$, we have:\\[\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)\\]This formula cannot be used directly because it would result in a division by zero. However, due to the point being on the positive y-axis, we conclude that:\\[\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\]Therefore, the point $(0, 3)$ in polar coordinates is $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.Hence, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration second. Now, the outer circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.4. For $j = 1$ (first case) and $j \\geq 2$ (next cases), we have the following expression for the outer circumference:   - For $j = 1$, the sum is taken as $1+c$.\n   - For $2 \\leq j \\leq c-1$, the sum is simplified to $2(c-j)$.\n   - For $j \\geq c$, the series converges to $1$.5. Applying these cases to the obtained outer sum, we get the total sum as follows:   - $1 + \\sum_{j=2}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3} = 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{c-1}\\frac{k+c}{(c-k)^3}$6. Using the double sum of the original problem, we have $p = \\sum_{k=1}^{c-1}\\frac{k+c}{(c-k)^3}$, and the original sum becomes $\\frac{p+c\\sum_{k=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{k^2}}{c-1}$.7. Comparing this expression with the given problem, we see that the series before the denominator is equal to $q$ ($\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}$).8. Therefore, $p + \\frac{q+c\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}}{c-1} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p + \\frac{q}{c-1}$. 9. The value of $c-1$ is $n-1$ (where $n$ is the number of terms in the sum), thus $p+c\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} = p + \\frac{\\color{red}{p}}{n-1} = p(1 + \\frac{1}{n-1}) = \\frac{p}{n-1}$.10. Simplifying the geometric progression, we get $q + \\color{red}{q} = 2q$.11. From the above equations, we find that $2q = \\color{red}{q + \\frac{q}{n-1}}$.12. The numerator row sum cancels out, $2q \\frac{p}{n-1} = q + \\frac{q}{n-1}$, which implies $2q \\frac{1}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n-1}$.13. Combining these steps, we get $q = \\frac{1}{n-1}$.### ConclusionTherefore, the answer is $p(1 + p)$. It's important to note that the text is concise, and the $n$ should be the number of terms in the sum, which is 1. Therefore, the final answer is:$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{n-1}(1 + p)}$.",
