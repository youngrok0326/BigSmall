The angle for a point on the positive y-axis is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees).Therefore, the polar coordinates are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.Please note that this solution is straightforward and the angle $\\arctan$ of a division of 3 by 0 cannot be directly simplified as such because $0$ looks like $3$ but it is not. It is a single point on the y-axis. Therefore, for the polar form, we meet the condition $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is within that range.Concluding this method, the final answer is:$\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$",
