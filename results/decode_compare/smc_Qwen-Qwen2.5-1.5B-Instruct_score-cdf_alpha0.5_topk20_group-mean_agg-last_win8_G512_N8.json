So substitute with\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]2. **Expression for $\\theta$**:\n   The value of $\\theta$ can be found based on the equation $y = r\\sin \\theta$. \n   Here, $y$ stands for the y-coordinate of the point, and $\\theta$ for the angle formed with the positive x-axis. Hence, rearranging this formula for $\\theta$ gives us,\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)\n   \\]\n   We know that $\\arctan(\\infty)$ gives $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, but due to the domain restrictions on $\\theta$, we need to adjust the result.\n   When we have a positive y-coordinate and a positive x-coordinate, like the case here, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.3. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the conversion to polar coordinates results in $(r,\\theta)$ as follows.

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$3. Substituting $x = p$, we then have:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{pj^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}$.4. Let's now perform the summation over $k$ in the inner sum:$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3} =\\frac{1}{j^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}= \\frac{1}{pj^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}$5. Let $d = q - p$, so now we have:$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3} =\\frac{1}{pj^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$6. Now, substitute this into the expression for the double sum:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{pj^3} \\left(\\frac{1}{ pj^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\right)$7. With the above substitution, we re-express the double sum as:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{(j^2 p)^3} + \\frac{1}{pj^3} \\left(\\frac{1}{pj^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\right)\\right)$8. After simplification, we have:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2 p)^3} + \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{pj^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$9. By the substitution of $x = p$, we obtain:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^4 p} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{pj^3}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$10. And we recognize the first sum, $x = p$:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{p} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1",
