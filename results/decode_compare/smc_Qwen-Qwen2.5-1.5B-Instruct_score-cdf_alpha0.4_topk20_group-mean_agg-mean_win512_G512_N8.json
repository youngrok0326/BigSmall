We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.\n    \\]3. Next, we rearrange the sums to simplify the expression:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.\n    \\]4. For the inner sum $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$, we realize that this sum behaves similarly to the original sum concerning $p$, but we need to adjust due to the specialization in $k$. Let's slightly rephrase:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{k^3} - \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\right)   \\right)\n    = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} - \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\right).\n    \\]5. By substituting $p$ for $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$, we achieve:    \\[\n    = p - \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\n    \\]6.
