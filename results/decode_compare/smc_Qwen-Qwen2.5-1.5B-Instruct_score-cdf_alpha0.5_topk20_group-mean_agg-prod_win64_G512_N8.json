For a vertical line ($x = 0$) with $y > 0$, the angle starts at $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and decreases linearly to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ as $x$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$.Since $x = 0$ here, we start at $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and increase it to $r = 3$.

We have\n\\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^m} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^{m-1}}. \\]Applying this to $m=2$, we get\n\\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k} \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\log \\frac{n^2}{n} = \\frac{\\log n}{n} \\approx \\frac{\\log n}{n}. \\]Since $p$ is defined as the sum of reciprocals of squares, i.e. $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$, we have $p \\approx \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{\\log n}{n}$.Next, we evaluate the inner sum in the double sum again, but this time for $m=3$ to write the $n$th element of the outer sum. We have\n\\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^3} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2}. \\]Applying this to $m=3$, we get\n\\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^3} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{p}{q} \\zeta(2) = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{p}{q} \\cdot \\zeta(2) \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{p}{q} \\cdot 1.645. \\]Since the expression in the double sum has $n^2$ terms, we have\n\\[ \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i + k)^n} \\approx \\frac{q}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{p}{q} \\cdot 1.645 = \\frac{p}{q}. \\]Therefore, we showed that the sum of the double sum is equal to $\\frac{p}{q} \\zeta(2)$.Maybe I was being a bit naive, but this problem could have been solved earlier by inverting sums using the series that I defined in my first answer. This leads to the following formula.Note that we have $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$, $q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$, and $\\zeta(2) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$.Using the partial fraction decomposition, one can rewrite the series that we started with as\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2} \\log \\frac{j + 1}{j}. \\]After a bit of manipulation, this can be written as\n\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^2} \\log \\frac{j + 1}{j} \\overset{?}{=} \\frac{p}{q} \\zeta(2). \\]The assertion is that this is true. This is in recognition of the fact that, after rescaling the partial fractions, the expression we want should be in the form of $p/q \\zeta(2)$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{p}{q} \\zeta(2)}$.",
