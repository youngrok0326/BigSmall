Now, we can see that $(0,3)$ lies on the positive (x) axis since the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the point to the center of the circle is 30 degrees.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\n\n$\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$\n\nSince we've already know that $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, we can calculate $r$ as follows:\n\n$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$\n\nNow, let's calculate $\\theta$:\n\n$\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$\n\nSince $\\arctan$ is undefined for angles less than 0, we need to find the arctangent to the angle of the output, which is $\\pi / 2$ radians.

          "completion": "Consider the last equation, which can be written as:\n\n\\[A = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\\]\n\nThis equation takes $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$. We want to rewrite this expression in terms of $p$ and $q$.\n\nLet's consider the different terms in the product above. We can split the terms into three parts:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& j + k \\\\\n\\cdots (j + k)^3 \\\\\n\\vdots\\vdots\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nAdding these up, we can see that we have 3 parts.\n\nNow let's rewrite each part as we were initially discussing. Consider the term j, which appears in the first part of each sum. We can write the first part as:\n\n\\[j \\approx k + k = k(1 + 1) + k = k + k. \\]\n\nSimilarly, we can write the second, third, etc. parts. \n\nWe will simply take the corresponding term and multiply it by its value. So we'll have\n\n\\[j + k + k + k + k + k + k + k + k = k(1 + 1) + k = k(1 + 1) + k(1 + 1) = 2k + 2k = 4k. \\] \n\nThis is helpful.\n\nFor the next part, we can do the same. We will have:\n\nThis term squares and cubed. The square is just $k$ times $k$ and each cubed is $(k + k - k + k) = k(k - k + k) = k$.

Substitute this into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty j \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k \\cdot j}. \\]\n\nSimplifying the inner sum:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k \\cdot j}. \\]\n\nMultiply and simplify:\n\n\\[ j \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k \\cdot j}. \\]\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\",
