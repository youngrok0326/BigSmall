          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k - j + 1)^3}.$$ 3. By applying the series, we have:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k - j + 1)^3}.$$4. Hence, we've successfully converted the double sum to a single sum of powers of $k$.5. Over here, you notice that the inner sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k - j + 1)^3}$ is similar to the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$, which we already have in terms of $p$ and $q$.6. So by reordering the terms, the desired expression $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ can be written as $p^2 + q^2$.7. Therefore, the given sum in terms of $p$ and $q$ is $p^2 + q^2$.### Conclusion:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = p^2 + q^2\n\\]Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{p^2 + q^2}$.",
