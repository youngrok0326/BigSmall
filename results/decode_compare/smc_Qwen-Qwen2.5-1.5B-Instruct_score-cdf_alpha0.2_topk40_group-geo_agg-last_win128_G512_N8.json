For each $j$, consider the sum of $\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}$ for all $k$ from 1 to infinity. This is a double sum, but we will focus on how it relates to $p$.Step 2: Recognize that the sum over $k$ for each $j$ is essentially the reciprocal of $j$ times the sum over $k$ of the reciprocal of $k^2$. This is a simple result of the definition of $p$.Step 3: We want to find a way to express the sum over all subsums of all $j$. We can do this by summing the contribution of each $j$ value.Step 4: The sum over $j$ is then the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals, which is $p$. This is important to note because it suggests a relationship between the original sums and the double sum.Step 5: The sum over $k$ gives the value of $q$, as per the definition of $q$.Therefore, the way to write the original sum in terms of $p$ and $q$ is by summing the contributions of each $j$ value, and dividing by the sum of the reciprocals of infinite terms. This gives us the final expression:\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{p}{q} \\]This analysis shows how the problem was broken down step by step, similar to how the problem was presented.",
