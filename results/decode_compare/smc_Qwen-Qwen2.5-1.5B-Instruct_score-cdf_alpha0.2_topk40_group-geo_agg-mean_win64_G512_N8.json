          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of the double sum as the expressions are finite to $k$ numbers. So now, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.3. By shifting indices, we can change the sum from $j$ to $k-j$ in the inner sum. Now we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.4. Let $m = j+k$. Now, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}$.5. We can now infer what we\u2019re looking for. We want $p = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(n+m)^2}$, which is equivalent to $p = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(m+n)^3}$.6. By shifting index, we need $p = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac1{(m+k)^3}$.7. So we need $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac1{(m+k)^3} = p + q - q = p$.8. Finally, by observing this $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac1{(m+k)^3} = p$ and it being the same, which we proved in step 3, we conclude that $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac1{(m+k)^3} = \\frac1{1!} + \\frac1{2^3} + \\frac1{3^3} + \\frac1{4^3} + \\cdots$.9. Hence, $p = 1 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\cdots$.10. Therefore, $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac1{(m+k)^3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\cdots$ is equivalent to $1 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\cdots$.11. Therefore, the final answer is: $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac1{(m+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\cdots) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\cdots) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\cdots) = \\frac{1}{10}$.Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
