Let's first evaluate the given infinite sum and then identify how it connects to \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\nConsider the double sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's change the order of summation. Instead of summing over \\( j \\) and \\( k \\) separately, we can write:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s change the variables to simplify the summation:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nHere, we substitute \\( m = j + k \\) and change the range of \\( k \\) from \\( 1 \\) to \\( j \\) to \\( j + 1 \\) to \\( \\infty \\). This substitution gives us:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we can split and adjust the summation:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{m=j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right).\n\\]\n\nWe recognize that the inner sum is partial from \\( j+1 \\) to \\( \\infty \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{m=j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{m=j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right).\n\\]\n\nTo make this sum more manageable, let's transform it into a new level sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nChange the limit of the new summation:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{j^3}.\n\\]\n\nWe can now interpret this sum as the sum of all \\( j \\) that are less than \\( m \\), starting from \\( m = 2 \\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{j^3}.\n\\]\n\nThis can be organized as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{j^3} \\right).\n\\]\n\nWe recognize that this inner sum is \\((p - 1)\\) because the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{j^2}\\) from \\( j = 1 \\) to \\(\\infty\\) is \\( p \\), but we subtract \\(1\\) at the start:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} ((p - 1) - \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{j^3}).\n\\",
