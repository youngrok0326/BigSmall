Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>To convert the point to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta.$</think>\n2. <think>The radius $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point, which is given by the formula $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ where $(x,y)$ are the rectangular coordinates of the point.</think>\n3. <think>Since the point is $(0,3),$ we can plug in the values into the formula:</think>\n  $r = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n4. <think>The angle $\\theta$ can be found using the formula $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{y}{x}),$ where $(x,y)$ are the rectangular coordinates of the point.</think>\n5. <think>Since $x = 0,$ the formula simplifies to: $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{3}{0}),$ which is undefined. However, since the point is above the $x$-axis, the angle $\\theta$ must be $\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$</think>\n6. <think>Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(r,\\theta) = (3,\\frac{\\pi}{2}).$</think>\n<answer>(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})</answer>\nProblem: Find the slope of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (6, 13).\nSolution: 1. <think>To find the slope of a line passing through two points, we use the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1},$ where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.</think>\n2. <think>In this case, the points are $(2, 5)$ and $(6, 13),$ so we can plug in the values into the formula:</think>\n  $m = \\frac{13 - 5}{6 - 2} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$\n3. <think>Therefore, the slope of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (6, 13) is $2.$</think>\n<answer>2</answer>\nProblem: In a jar, there are 20 red socks and 10 white socks. If I reach into the back of the drawer and randomly draw out 3 socks, what is the probability that I will draw 2 red socks and 1 white sock?\nSolution: 1. <think>To find the probability of drawing 2 red socks and 1 white sock, we need to find the number of ways to draw 2 red socks and 1 white sock, and then divide that by the total number of ways to draw 3 socks from the jar.</think>\n2. <think>The number of ways to draw 2 red socks and 1 white sock can be found using combinations, which is given by the formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!},$ where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to be drawn.</think>\n  $C(20, 2) \\cdot C(10, 1) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} \\cdot \\frac{10!}{1!(10-1)!} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 19}{2} \\cdot 10 = 380 \\cdot 10 = 3800$\n3. <think>The total number of ways to draw 3 socks from the jar is also given by the formula $C(n, k),$ where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to be drawn.</think>\n  $C(30, 3",
