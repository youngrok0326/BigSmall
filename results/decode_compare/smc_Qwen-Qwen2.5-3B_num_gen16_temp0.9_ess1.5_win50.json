The divisor function is an arithmetic function that gives the number of divisors of an integer. Let a be a positive integer. The divisor function gives the number of divisors of a as the number of factors of the prime factorization of a. The prime factorization of 196 is 2 2 * 7 2. The number of divisors of 196 is 1 2+1 * 1 2+1 = (2+1)(2+1) = 3 * 3 = 9. </think>\n<answer> 9 </answer>\nProblem: A school's graduating class can be divided into 3 equal sections. Additionally, the school holds an annual dance and the graduating class is also divided into 3 equal sections for the dance. How many people are in the graduating class if the number of people in the dance sections is 180?\nSolution: <think> The number of the number is x/3, so the number is x/3 + 25. We can substitute: 1/3x = x/3 + 25\nthink\nx is the number. x/3 is 1/3 of the number. x/3 + 25 is the number. The equation is x/3 = x/3 + 25.\nanswer\nx/3 = x/3 + 25\nProblem: A six-sided die is rolled eight times. What is the probability that the die will show a six at least once?\nSolution:\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die, and only one of them is a six. So, the probability of not rolling a six on a single roll is 5/6. To find the probability of rolling a six at least once, it is easier to find the probability of not rolling a six at all and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of not rolling a six in a single roll is 5/6.\n\nThe probability of not rolling a six on all 8 rolls is (5/6)^8.\n\nNow, subtract this value from 1 to get the probability?\nSolution:\n\nAssistant: a six at least once: 1 - (5/6)^8.\nanswer\n1 - 2+1, we can reach 8 students and 3 reach the others. The remaining students will be 6 - 1 - 3 = 2. Thus, 2 out of the 6 remaining students will reach 8, and the remaining 4 students will reach the others. This gives us 2 * 8 + 4 = 20 students. Therefore, the 20 students that reach the first 8 students will pay 3 \u00d7 120 = $360. For 7 people, they will pay 7 \u00d7 120 = $840. The cost per person for a vacation with 7 people is $840.\n\nAssistant: Problem: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\nSolution: 196 can be rewritten as 196 = (2)(2)(2)(7)(7). To find the number of divisors, multiply one more than each exponent: 2+1 * 2+1 * 2+1 * 7+1 * 7+1 . This gives 6 * 6 * 6 = 216.\nthink: How many whole-number divisors does 196 have?\nanswer: 216\nProblem: For integers n and k, n is the product of 5 and the square of 3, and n/k is an odd integer.

We can calculate the average speed for each student by dividing the distance by the time. For Evelyn, the average speed is 4.5 / 1.25 = 3.6 units per hour. For Briana, the average speed is 2.2 / 2.5 = 0.88 units per hour. For Carla, the average speed is 5.2 / 4.25 = 1.22 units per hour. For Angela, the average speed is 2.8 / 5.6 = 0.5 units per hour.
