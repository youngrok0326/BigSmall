Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of $r$ and $\\theta$.\nThe formula for converting rectangular coordinates $(x,y)$ to polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ is:\n$$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$$\nIn this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$. So, we can plug these values into the formulas:\n$$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$$\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$$\nSince $\\tan^{-1}$ is undefined when the denominator is zero, we need to consider the special case when $x = 0$. In this case, the point lies on the positive $y$-axis, so $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n</think>\n2. <answer>\n(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n</answer>",

Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. From the graph, we can see that each student runs a total distance of 6 units.

For Briana, the average speed is 6 / 2.5 = 2.4 units per unit of time. For Carla, the average speed is 6 / 4.25 = 1.41 units per unit of time.
