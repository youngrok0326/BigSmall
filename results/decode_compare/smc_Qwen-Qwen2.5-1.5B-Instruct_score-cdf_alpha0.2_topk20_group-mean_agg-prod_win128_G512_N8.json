Let's calculate $r$ and $\\theta$:$$ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $$Now, for $\\theta$, we consider the value of $y$ as $y > 0$ because our given rectangular coordinates have $y > 0$. Thus,$$ \\tan \\theta = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{3}{0} $$Since $\\tan \\theta$ would be undefined if $x = 0$, it suggests that $\\theta$ would lie in the second quadrant.

A useful approach is to consider the double sum in a different order. We can split the inner sum over all pairs \\((j, k)\\) and bound it appropriately.The double sum can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]We can separate the sum over \\(j\\) and \\(k\\):\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} - \\frac{1}{q}. \\]Here, the term \\(\\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} - \\frac{1}{q}\\) comes from the series expansion where the nested sums are treated as some regularization of the double sum, assuming the identity above from a specific reference (which is supposed to hold algebraically).We now substitute the known values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\):\n\\[ \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} - \\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} - \\frac{1}{\\zeta(3)} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} - \\frac{1}{\\zeta(3)}. \\]Finally, we recognize that these are just \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), respectively.
