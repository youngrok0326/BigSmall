Calculate $r$:  \n   Since the value of $x$ is $0$, we cannot divide by $x$ directly, so we note that the point is on the $y$-axis. When we draw a circle with radius $r$ centered at the origin, it lies on the positive $y$-axis. Therefore, $r=3$.2. Calculate $\\theta$:  \n   Since $x=0$ and $y=3$, we know that the angle $\\theta$ is $90^\\circ$ or $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",

We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:   Step 1: Rewrite the double sum as an improper integral.\n   \\[ \\int_0^1\\int_0^1\\frac{x}{(x + z)^3}dy\\;dz\\]   Step 2: Integrate the inner term with respect to $y$:\n   \\[ + \\int_0^1 \\frac{z}{1 - z} dy\\]3. Evaluate the terms of the integral on the right-hand side:3.1. The first integral represents the sum of the series:\n   \\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(x + z)^3} dz \\]   For the first term, when $x = 1$:    \\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(x + z)^3} \\; dx \\]   Let $x = z$, thus $dx = dz$:\n   \\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{(1) + z}^3 dz \\]   The antiderivative of the term inside the integral is:\n   \\[ \\frac{-1}{2z^2} \\]   Subtracting the lower limit $z = 0$ we get:\n   \\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{-1}{2(1)^2} - \\frac{-1}{2(0)^2}\\right) \\]   Simplifies to:\n   \\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\]3.2. The second integral represents the sum of the series:\n   \\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\int_0^1 \\frac{z}{1 - z}\\; dz \\]4. The second integral represents the sum of the series:\n   \\[ \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\int_0^1 \\frac{z}{1 - z}\\; dz \\]   The antiderivative of the term inside the integral is:\n   \\[ \\log\\left(\\frac{1 - z}{z}\\right) \\]   Evaluating for the upper limit $z = 1$ and subtracting the lower limit $z = 0$ we get:\n   \\[ \\log\\left(\\frac{0}{1}\\right) - \\log\\left(\\frac{1 - 0}{1}\\right) \\]   Simplified:\n   \\[ \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{0}\\right) - \\log(1) \\]   Thus, doing the same steps as above we get:\n   \\[ -\\log(\\text{something}) + \\log(1)\\]   The minus and plus cancel out to:\n   \\[ \\log(\\text{something}) \\]5. Combining both terms, we get:\n   \\[ \\frac{1}{2} - \\log(\\text{something}) \\]6.
