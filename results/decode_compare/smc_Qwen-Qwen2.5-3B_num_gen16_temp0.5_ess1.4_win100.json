We can use the fact that $p$ and $q$ are known sums, and try to manipulate the given sum to match one of these known sums.\n</think>\n2. <think>\nWe can start by expressing the given sum as a double sum.

We can write:\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\\]\n</think>\n5. <think>\nFinally, we can use the fact that $p$ and $q$ are known sums to express the given sum in terms of $p$ and $q$.
