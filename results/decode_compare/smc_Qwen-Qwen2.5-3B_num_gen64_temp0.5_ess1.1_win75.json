          "completion": "1. <think>\nTo find a way to write the given sum in terms of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), we can start by expressing the sum in a different form. We can use the fact that \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are known series and try to relate the given sum to these known series.\n\nFirst, consider the given sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this sum by changing the order of summation. Let \\( m = j + k \\). Then, for each \\( m \\), \\( j \\) and \\( k \\) can take values such that \\( j + k = m \\). This means \\( j \\) can range from 1 to \\( m-1 \\), and \\( k \\) will be \\( m - j \\). Therefore, the sum can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we can factor out \\( \\frac{1}{m^3} \\) from the inner sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\sum_{j = 1}^{m-1} 1.\n\\]\n\nThe inner sum \\( \\sum_{j = 1}^{m-1} 1 \\) simply counts the number of terms in the range from 1 to \\( m-1 \\), which is \\( m-1 \\). Therefore, the sum becomes:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} (m-1).\n\\]\n\nWe can split this sum into two separate sums:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{m-1}{m^3} = \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{m^2} - \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis can be further simplified as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} - \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nWe recognize that the first sum is \\( p - 1 \\) (since \\( \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} = p \\) and we exclude the \\( m = 1 \\) term):\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} = p - 1.\n\\]\n\nThe second sum is \\( q - 1 \\) (since \\( \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} = q \\) and we exclude the \\( m = 1 \\) term):\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} = q - 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the original sum can be written as:\n\\[\n(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\\]\n\n2. <answer>\n\\[\n\\boxed{p - q}\n\\]",
