Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$-sum) change of variables: $k = j + t$, then $k = t + 1$. This gives you:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+t)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+t)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j + t)^3}$$3. Perform the new outer circle ($j$-sum) change of variables: $j = s + 1$, then $j = s + k$. This gives you:$$\\sum_{t = 1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{s = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(t + s)^3} = \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{s=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(t + s)^3}$$4. Perform the new outer circle ($s$-sum) change of variables: $s = \\frac{1}{t}$, then $s = 1 - \\frac{1}{t}$ to remain inside the sum bound. This gives you:$$\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{s = 0}^{k}\\frac{1}{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{t}\\right)^t} = \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{s = 0}^{k}\\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{t}{t-1}\\right)^t}$$5. Controlling the values inside the inner inner sum which we now know from 3:$$\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{s = 0}^{k}\\frac{1}{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{t}\\right)^t} = \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{s = 0}^{k}\\frac{1}{(t-1)^{t-1}}$$6. The remaining sum can now be separated into a step with the outer circle ($s$-sum) and the inner circle ($k$-sum), which gives you:$$\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{s = 0}^{k}\\frac{1}{(t-1)^{t-1}} = \\sum_{s = 0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k = 0}^{s}\\frac{1}{(t-1)^{t-1}}$$7. Now, flip the characters' steps according to the former step's change for the inner circle and subtract the sum of first index steps (for $s$):$$\\sum_{s = 0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k = 0}^{s}\\frac{1}{(t-1)^{t-1}} - \\sum_{s = 0}^{1}\\sum_{k = 0}^{s}\\frac{1}{(t-1)^{t-1}} = \\sum_{s = 1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k = 0}^{s-1}\\frac{1}{(t-1)^{t-1}}$$8. By introducing the variable $p$ for the first circle series and substitute $t = p$, this results in:$$\\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k^3}$$In conclusion, the sum in question can now be represented as:\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\]as:\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^1 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k^3} + p\\sum_{j = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k^3}\\]Therefore, we conclude that the answer is:\\boxed{\\sum_{",
