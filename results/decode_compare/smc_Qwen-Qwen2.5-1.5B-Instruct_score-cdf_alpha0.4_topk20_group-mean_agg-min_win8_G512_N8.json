          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration. In this case, when $j + k = c$, $j$ can be written as $c - k$. Now the outer circle becomes the sum: $\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{c-k}{(c-k)^3}$ or $\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{k+1}{(k+1)^3}$.4. This can be simplified to $\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{k+1}{(k+1)^3} = \\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(k+1)^2}$. 5. For this, we can use the approximation $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6} + \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right).$6.

Thus, the given sum becomes equivalent to $\\frac{p - \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}}{4} = \\frac{p}{4} - \\frac{p}{24}$.
