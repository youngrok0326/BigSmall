Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  To convert the point $(0,3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of $r$ and $\\theta$. \n\nHere's how we do it step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Identify the given point\nWe're given $(0,3)$, which means the x-coordinate is 0, and the y-coordinate is 3.\n\nStep 2: Determine the radius, $r$ \nThe radius $r$ is the distance from the point to the origin (0,0) in the coordinate plane. Mathematically, the radius is the square root of the sum of squares of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate. So,\n$ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\nPlugging in the values,\n$ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2}$\n$ r = \\sqrt{9}$\n$ r = 3$\n\nStep 3: Determine the angle, $\\left(x = 0,\\ y = 3\\right)$ from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.\nStep 2: Calculate the angle $\\theta$ between the line connecting the origin $\\left(0,0\\right)$ $\\left(\u03b8 = 0\\right)$ and the point $\\left(0,3\\right)$ $\\left(\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\) rectangle, by using Pythagorean theorem. \nFirst, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\nStep1:  $9 = r^2 \\cdot \\tan \\theta$\nStep2:  We can divide both sides of the equation by $\\tan \\theta$:\nStep1:  $\\frac{9}{\\tan \\theta} = r$\nStep1:  Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3}$\n$\\theta = \\frac{\\frac{6x + 2y}{2:  $r = \\frac{9}{",
