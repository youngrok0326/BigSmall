          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of the double sum as the expressions are finite to $k$ numbers. So now, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.3. If we now take $k \\rightarrow k+1$, we can reorganize it to get $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k+1)^3}$. 4. Since the point is that we can replace $k$ with $k+1$ this looks like a valid operation but actually must be true for an interchange of the order of double sum. Let's substitute $k$ with $k+1$ in the original expression, to see if the new form makes sense.5. Therefore, the expression $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(k+1)^3}{(j+k+1)^3}$ appears as a key trick.6. Now let's write another form for the double sum:\n    \\[\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(k+1)^3}{(j+k+1)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{k^3}{(j+k+1)^3 + j^3}\\]\n  \n7. Here the key substitution was $k \\rightarrow k+1$, so the upper bound on $k$ is arbitrary.8. Subtracting and adding $1$ in the denominator on the RHS of the double sum\n    \\[\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k+1)^3} - \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{k}{(j+k+1)^3}\\]\n    \\[\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{k}{(j+k+1)^3} = k\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k+1)^3}\\]\n    \n9. Replacing $k$ with $k+1$, we find the right hand side redone into $k$, \\[\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{k+1}{(j+k+2)^3}\\]10. Therefore, the expression becomes\n    \\[\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k+1)^3}]\\]\n    \n11. To sum the expression, we need to subtract the summation of the given part from the double summation. But we got a little trick up our sleeve, that double summation which counters each term $1$ in the part we're trying to find in very interesting way.\n    \n12. Since it's true for $1/(j+k)^3$, we can see that the reverse operation will work. Therefore, we can see $1$ in the expression we're summing is cancelled in the reverse double summation. \n    \n13. So now, we have to sum the expression in the bracket which becomes $p-q$ for the part we're summing.\n```\n       \\boxed{p-q}\n```",
