In this case, we can use the formula for the distance in a Cartesian plane between two points:\n\\[r = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\]\nwhere $x_1, y_1, x_2,$ and $y_2$ are the coordinates of the point.Step 2: Calculate the coordinates of the point. Here the point's $y$ coordinate is already provided as $3$ (no change needed), so we only need the $x$ coordinate.Step 3: Convert this $x$ coordinate from the Cartesian plane to polar coordinates. The formulae for converting to polar coordinates are:\n\\[r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\\]Step 4: Calculate the $r$, $\\theta$ values. We already calculated the $x$ coordinate as $3$. Since we want the $x$ coordinate to be the radius and the unit $\\theta$; we simply divide the $x$ by $3$.Here are some plots for your point $(0,3)$ in vector and polar coordinates:[Image of each](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dd7re7p9qy)Since the point is given in rectangular coordinates, I'll show you the point's position through its components $(x,y)$:The point $(0,3)$ lies 3 units from the origin, with the $x$-component of $3$ indicating the horizontal distance and the $y$-component of $0$ indicating the vertical distance. This average will give us the center of mass in Cartesian coordinates.As for polar coordinates, the formula for converting a point from rectangular coordinates $(x,y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ is:\\[r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\]\n\\[\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\\]To get our point $(0,3)$'s polar representation, let's perform these steps:- Calculate the magnitude of the vector $(3, 0)$, which is the Euclidean distance between $(0,3)$ and the origin in terms of the radial component (rad",
