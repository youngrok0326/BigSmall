          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of the double sum as the expressions are finite to $k$ numbers. So now, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.3. Let's focus on how we sum over $k$. Fixing a particular value $k$ with $k\\geq 1$, the expression becomes $\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=k+1}^\\infty{\\frac{1}{(j+1)(j+2)...(j+k)}}$.4. Now, we transform the summation by introducing an extra variable $l$, where $j + l = k + 1$, then we change variables from $j$ to $l$ and the sum becomes $\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+l+1)(j+l+2)...(j+l+k)}$.5. For $l\\geq 1$ and $j\\geq 1$, we have $\\frac{1}{(l + 1)^2(l + 2)^2... (l + k)^2} =\\frac{1}{(l+1)^2}(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{l(l + k) + l})$. 6. Note that\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{l(l+k)+l} = \\frac{1}{l}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+(\\frac{k}{l})} =\\frac{1}{l}\\cdot \\ln\\frac{l}{l-1} = \\frac{\\ln l}{l}\\]7. Combine this as, for $l=1$ the first sum is equal to 1 and for $l>1$ the sum will be $1 - \\frac{1}{l}$, so we get $1 - \\sum_{l=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{l(l+1)}$. After summing terms ($\\mathfrak{H}$) and adjusting the results to isolate the series, we get $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(l+1)^2(l + 2)^2... (l + k)^2} \\cdot \\mathfrak{H}\\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{\\ln\\frac{1}{k}}{l}$.8. Therefore,\n\\[ \\sum_{l=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{l=1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{l}[\\ln\\frac{1}{l}- \\ln\\frac{1}{l-2}]\\]9. Simplifying this expression, we can take the sum of the logarithms. This gives $\\frac{\\ln\\frac{1}{l}}{l} - \\frac{\\ln\\frac{1}{l-2}}{l}$.10. Finally, these two terms are $p$ and $q$, respectively.11. By substituting, we have\n\\[ p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\\]12. Since equating $p = \\frac{\\ln \\mathfrak{H}}{\\mathfrak{H}}$ and subtracting the first term to isolate the second gives $q$, we express $q - p$ in terms of $p$ and $q$, and equate the two.13. Hence, the sum is $2p - q$. 14. Substituting the values gives $2p - q = \\frac{19}{16}$.15. Therefore, the final answer is $2p-q = \\boxed{2p-q = \\frac{19}{16}}$.",
