Notice that for probabilities and series expansions using known sums, we may need additional definitions.### Step 2: Sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\)We need to expand the given triple sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\n\\]This sum can be thought of as a symmetrized version of the division sum.
