          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$3. Now, move the term $\\frac{1}{j^3}$ around the sum:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\right) = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\left(p(\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3} - \\frac{1}{j^3})\\right) = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{p}{j^2} - \\frac{p}{(j+1)^2}\\right)$4. We can see that $\\frac{p}{j^2} - \\frac{p}{(j+1)^2} = \\frac{p}{j^2} - \\frac{p}{(j+1)^2} = \\frac{p}{j^2} - \\frac{p}{(j+1)^2} = \\frac{p}{j^2} (j^2 - (j+1)^2) = \\frac{-2p}{(j+1)^j}$.5. The second term can be re-expressed as follows:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\left(p(\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3} - \\frac{1}{j^3})\\right) = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\left(p(\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3} - \\frac{1}{j^3})\\right) = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{p}{(j+1)^3} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{(j+1)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{p}{(j+1)^3} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{(j+1)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{p}{(j+1)^3} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 2\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{p}{(j+1)^3}\\frac{2}{(j+1)^3} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{p}{(j+1)^3}\\frac{2}{(j+1)^3}p$.6. Therefore, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{p}{(j+1)^3}\\frac{2}{(j+1)^3}q = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{p}{(j+1)^3} \\frac{2p}{(j+1)^2} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty  \\frac{p^2}{(j+1)^3}$.7. Thus we have a way to write $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ in terms of $p$ and $q$.8",

Let's correct it.## Step 1: Prime factorization of 196 yields $2^2 \\cdot 7^2 = 4 \\cdot 49 = 196$.## Step 2: Applying the exponent rule, each unique prime factor (here 2 and 7) will contribute to the divisor count in the range from 0 to the total exponent of that prime in its factorization.Since 2 is raised to the power 2 and 7 to the power 2, each factor has 3 unique divisors. Therefore, we multiply the number of choices (3) to itself to account for the combined possibilities of 2 and 7.## Step 3: Calculate the total number of divisors for 196.\n- We have 3 choices for the first 2^2 = 4 factors (why, four? because the exponent of 2 is two).  \n- Similarly, for the next set of factors, given the exponent of 7 is two, we have 3 choices again.Multiplying these together, (3)(3) gives the total number of divisors, which equals $9$.Therefore, the correct answer is 9.",
