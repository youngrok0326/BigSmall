Now let's find $\\theta$:To find $\\theta$, we need to use the arctangent function again:$\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{3}{0} \\right)$Since we are taking the arctangent of a value approaching zero, it actually gives us an angle that is very close to 90 degrees (also known as 0.0 by convention). This means that $\\theta$ is essentially 90 degrees. However, to make it more precise, we can use the arctangent function with a positive value:$\\theta = \\arctan (3)$${\\theta = \\arctan(3)}$ \u2248 75.24 degreesNow that we have our $r$ and $\\theta$, we can use the following formulas to convert the coordinates to polar coordinates:$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$y = r \\cos \\theta$$x = r \\sin \\theta$Substituting the values we found earlier:$r = 3$$\\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$$\\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{3}{3}$This gives us:$r = 3$Simplify:$x = r \\sin \\theta$and$y = r \\cos \\theta$Substituting the values we found earlier:$x = 3 \\sin \\theta$and$y = 3 \\cos \\theta$So, the final polar coordinates are:$r = 3$And we have:$x = 3$And we have:$(",
