          "completion": "To convert the rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we use the following formulas:1. $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ (for the distance from the origin to the point)\n2. $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$ (for the angle from the positive x-axis to the point, projected onto the positive x-axis by the right-hand rule)For the point $(0,3)$, we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3$.First, we calculate $r$:$$\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3.\n$$Next, we need to determine $\\theta$. Since $x = 0$ and we are in the first or third quadrant for this specific case, we can use the fact that the y-coordinate alone gives us the angle as it will be negative in the third quadrant and positive in the first quadrant. However, upon closer inspection, the y-coordinate alone does not directly give the angle here because it's not in the first or third quadrant (it's on the y-axis). Instead, a more direct formula to find the angle $\\theta$ between the positive x-axis and the line from the origin to the point $(x, y)$ is the arctangent of the ratio of y to x. Given that x is at 0, it essentially means the angle $\\theta$ from 0 to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or from $\\pi$ to $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ needs to account for the vertical jump. This angle simply is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.Therefore:$$\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)\n$$In this case, because the line is falling off the screen at dead on to 90 degrees, not taking into account the math directly gives us the correct angle for our scenario, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.So, the polar coordinates for the point $(0,3)$ are:$$\n(r, \\theta) = (3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n$$Therefore, the final answer is:$$\n\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\n$$",

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + j)^3}.\n\\]We see that we have reversed the order of the summation:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\n\\]3. By interchanging the order of summation, we can combine inner sums:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}.\n\\]4. Re-interpreting the inner sum as $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j(j + k)^2}$:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2}.\n\\]5. Expanding the inner double sum, we have $\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2}$. Once again, we interchange the order ofthe sums:\\[\n\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2} = \\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{l^2}\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2}.\n\\]6. Combining all sums, we get:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2}.\n\\]7. Since the terms cancel out, we are left with:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{l = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + l)^2}.\n\\]8. Therefore, the given sum can be rewritten in terms of $p$ and $q$.The sum in question is,\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac 1{p^2}q.\n\\]",
