          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[ = \\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]\n\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\\]3. By interchanging the order of summation and shifting the index, we can write this as:\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}.\\]4. Define $s = q$. Now we have:\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}.\\]5. Next, we manipulate the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[ = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}=\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}= \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}.\\]6. By reindexing the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$, we get:\\[ = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}= \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k)^3}.\\]7. Define $t = p$. This gives us the following:\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k = j + 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k)^3} = \\sum_{L = 2}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^{L - 1}\\frac{1}{j^3\\left(\\frac{L + 1 - j}{j}\\right)^3}.\\]8. Simplifying the above expression, we find:\\[ = \\sum_{L = 2}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^{L - 1}\\frac{1}{L^3(L - j)}.\\]9. Further simplification leads us to:\\[ = \\sum_{L = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{",
