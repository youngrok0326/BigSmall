          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[c = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{((j + k) + (j + k)) + (j + k - j)}\\right)\\]\n\\[c = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{(2j + k + 1)}\\right)\\]3. We then incorporate the sum by $k$ that we formed in Step 1 and use the same idea as in Step 2:\\[c = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{2j + k + 1}\\right)\\]4. Thus, we switch the order of the nested sums:\\[c = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2j + k + 1}\\]\n\\[c = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k + 1 + j}\\]5. We can now change the order of the sums back. We see that the double sum can be rewritten as:\\[c = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k + 1}\\left(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j}\\right)\\]6. We know that $C = p$, and by definition of $p$, as of $j = 1$, $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j} = p$. This is okay because $1 < p < 2$.7. Consequently, we can substitute the inner sum to get:\\[c = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k + 1}p\\]\n\\[c = \\frac{p}{2}\\left(\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k + 1}\\right)\\]8. We change the order of the sums again and calculate:\\[c = \\frac{p}{2} \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k + 1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\]9. Again, as before, we can change the order of the sums to get:\\[c = \\frac{p^3}{3} \\left(\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k + 1}\\right)\\]10. We then notice that the remaining sum is identical to $q$.11. Therefore:\\[c = \\frac{p^3}{3} \\left(\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k + 1}\\right)\\]12. Hence, substituting the value of $c$ and $q$:\\[c = \\frac{p^3}{3}q\\]13. Finally, we conclude that the double sum can be written in terms of $p$ and $q$ as follows:\\[\\sum_{j + k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{p^3}{3}q\\]",
