          "answer": "9",
          "completion": "## Step 1: Prime factorization of 196\nTo find the number of divisors, we'll first need to find the prime factorization of 196.196 can be factored into prime numbers as: $196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2$.## Step 2: Use the formula for finding divisors\nThe formula to find the number of divisors of a number $n$ with prime factorization $n = p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{e_k}$ is given by $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_k + 1)$. This formula comes from the fact that for each divisor of $n$, we can assign a subset of the exponents $e_i$ (including empty subsets, which correspond to the divisors 1 and $n$).Here, we have two prime factors, each raised to the second power: $2^2$ and $7^2$.Therefore, divisors of $196$ will be the sums of increased powers of $2$ and $7$, up to their maximum exponent.## Step 3: Calculate all possible combinations\nStarting with the smallest power of each prime, we can assign either $0$ or $1$ to the power of each prime in all combinations. This gives:- For $2$, we have $2^0, 2^1$.\n- For $7$, we have $7^0, 7^1$.The combinations of these possibilities for $2$ and $7$ will give us the total number of divisors, which is the product of these sums plus one (to include the factor itself).1. All combinations for $2$ yield: $(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n2. All combinations for $7$ yield: $(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.Thus, any combination of these will result in $9$ divisors, since each doubling of either prime maintains the number of possible pairs.## Step 4: Conclusion\nTherefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of $196$ is: $9$.Final Answer: $9$.",
