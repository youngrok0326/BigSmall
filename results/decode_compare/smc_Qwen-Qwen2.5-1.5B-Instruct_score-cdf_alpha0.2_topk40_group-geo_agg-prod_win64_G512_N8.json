          "completion": "To convert the rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we use the following formulas:1. For $r$:  \n$$ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $$2. For $\\theta$:  \n$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) $$If $x > 0$, then there is no need to add or subtract any values to the arctan result, as the arctan function returns values in the range $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. Therefore, we only need to add or subtract multiples of $\\pi$ to the arctan result if $x < 0$ to ensure the proper range of $\\theta$.Given the point $(0, 3)$, where $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, let's apply the formulas:1. For $r$:  \n$$ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $$2. For $\\theta$:  \nSince we cannot directly compute the arctan of a value with an $x$-coordinate of $0$ (because the function is undefined there), the $\\arctan$ result will be undefined or out of range.However, we can use the fact that this question asks for the polar coordinates and has specified that $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$. Since $x$ is $0$ and $y$ is $3$, the point lies on the positive y-axis. This means $\\theta$ would be $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, as $0 \\le \\theta$ is the first quadrant where the angle on the y-axis is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.Therefore, the polar coordinates are:$$ (r, \\theta) = (3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $$By following through with the formulas, we can confirm that our calculation is correct, and we have all the required components for the polar coordinates. Therefore, the final answer is:$\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$",

For each $j$, consider the sum of $\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}$ for all $k$ from 1 to infinity. This is a double sum, but we will focus on how it relates to $p$.Step 2: Recognize that if we could express the double sum as a function of $p$, then multiplying the result by $q$ (the second part of the question) would essentially be solving the original problem. The key insight is that the inner sum can be seen as a way to approximate $\\frac{1}{k^2}$ from above, but not quite reaching infinity. So, we can think of the total sum as a piece of a larger, more complex series that can be tied to $p$ by exploring the series' structure more closely.Step 3: We will use the fact that the series $\\frac{1}{k^2}$ and $\\frac{1}{k^3}$ do not converge in the conventional sense (i.e., they do not have finite partial sums as $k$ approaches infinity). However, we can still relate them through a double series. By working through the double sum, we can express the inner sum as a function of $p$ (the first part of the question). We then use $q$ (the second part of the question) to relate the double sum to $p$ (the first part of the question). \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \n&= (p - \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k + j)^2} \\\\\n&= (p - q)\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{p - q}$.",
