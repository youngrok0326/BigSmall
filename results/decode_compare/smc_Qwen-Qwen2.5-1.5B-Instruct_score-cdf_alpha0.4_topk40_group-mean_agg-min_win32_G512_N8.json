Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration next. The outer circle becomes the familiar sum of hyper numbers: $c\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)} = c\\underbrace{\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j}}_{p} - \\underbrace{\\sum_{j=1}^{c-2}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}}_{\\text{Just added or subtracted?}}$.4. Here, the terms under the first sum remain as the definition of $p$, while the terms under the second sum don't exist. Thus, the answer is $c-p$. 5. Plugging in the definition of $p$, back-substitute $p$ for $c$, and use the value of the sum over $j$ is $p$, you get: $\\boxed{p - q}$.",
