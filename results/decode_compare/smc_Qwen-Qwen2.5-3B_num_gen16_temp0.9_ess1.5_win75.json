Substituting these into the original expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n   \\]\n   where $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}$ is from the minimum value of $n$ which is 2, because if $n < 2$, we cannot have $j + k > 1$. Similarly, $\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}$ is from the minimum value of $m$, which is 1.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Sum:**\n   Now, we rewrite the above sum as:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} 1\n   \\]\n   Since $\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} 1$ is an infinite sum of 1s and is not well-defined, let\u2019s correct our setup by ensuring it\u2019s a meaningful infinite sum. Consider the next expansion.\n\n4. **Exponential Term:**\n   Rewrite the main expression in terms of an exponential function:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n   \\]\n   The inner sum becomes the term for $q$:\n\n5. **Relating to $q$:**\n   Notice that each term of the inner sum is essentially $q$, so:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} \\cdot q\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Expression:**\n   Thus, the given sum in terms of $p$ and $q$ can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = q \\cdot \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n   \\]\n   Since $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$ is the sum from $n=2$ to infinity, and $p$ is the sum from $n=1$ to infinity, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{p}{q} + \\left(q - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{",
