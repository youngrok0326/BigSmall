Given the rectangular coordinates $(0,3)$, we start by finding the distance $r$ from the origin $(0,0)$ to the point $(0,3)$.\n   \n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{(x_1-0)^2 + (y_1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]2. Next, we find the angle $\\theta$ using the arctangent function. Knowing that the y-coordinate is positive and the x-coordinate is zero, it places us in either the first or the third quadrant. Given that the point $(0,3)$ is above the x-axis, it lies in the first quadrant.   \\[\n   \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(undefined)\n   \\]   Since the arctangent value is undefined, we need to be cautious as it addresses a special case.    - The equation $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{3}{0}$ has no real solution because division by zero is undefined. Thus, the angle approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (or 90 degrees). However, it does not reach $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, because the point $(0,3)$ is exactly on the y-axis and does not leave the first quadrant due to the equation's nature and given point.Thus, combining these steps, the polar coordinates are $(r,\\theta)$.Since neither the radiative function scales the value, we have the same magnification and positivity for $r$ given our context and constraints:\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\]This step-by-step compilation leads to the confirmation that there is no standard way to translate the given rectangular coordinates $(0,3)$ directly to polar without larger scale adjustments or due to undefined functions for those conditions. The simple direct transitions do not adjust nor redefine the values for the respective quadrants.Thus deriving the value and placing in quadrants, leading us to the end point as not possible without recalibration.Therefore, to correctly conclude with the problem and derive within construct considered options for the real problem outline here, $r$ equals:\\[\nr = 3\n\\]And the angle $\\theta$ as:\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\]Thus:\\[\n(r,\\theta) = (3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})\n\\]Let's conclude both the process and involve the final parameters effectively.Therefore, the final answer is:\\boxed{(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})}",
