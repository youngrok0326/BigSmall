Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 0\nThe Reasoning:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The formulas used to convert Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ are:\n$$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$\n$$\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$$\nThe first formula can be used to find the value of $r$. Since $x = 0$, the formula becomes:\n$$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$$\nNow we need to find $\\theta$. To find $\\theta = \\theta = \\arctan\\frac{3}{0}$.
