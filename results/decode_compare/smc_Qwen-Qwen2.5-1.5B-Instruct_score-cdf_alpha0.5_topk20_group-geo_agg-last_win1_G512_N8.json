          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2(m + \\frac{1}{j})^3}.\n\\]3. We can see that in this equation, we've now converted the $j$-sum into an $m$-sum. Next, we exchange the order of summation.4. When we \"collapse\" the second and third sums, we have:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = m + 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{m^3(j + \\frac{m}{k})^3} = \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\left(\\left[ \\frac{k}{m}\\right]+\\frac{k^{-1}}{m}\\right)^3}.\n\\]5. We eventually obtain:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{j}\\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right)^{-1} = \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{[\\frac{k}{m}]} \\frac{1}{k}.\n\\]6. We recognize the left-hand side as $q$, so we have $q = \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{[\\frac{k}{m}]} \\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^{-1}$.7. We can rewrite this $q$ as:\\$\nq = \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{[\\frac{k}{m}]} \\frac{1}{k} = \\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(m n)^2} .\n\\]8. We factor out the term $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^2}$, so we have:\\$\nq = \\sum_{[\\frac{k}{m}]} \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(m n)^2}.\n\\]9. We now have both sides equal to $q$ and can equate the two:$$\\sum_{[\\frac{k}{m}]} \\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(m n)^2} = \\sum_{[\\frac{k}{m}]} \\frac{1}{m^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{j}\\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right)^{-1}.\n$$10. The two sides can now be factored similar to the step above.11. Therefore,$$\\sum_{[\\frac{k}{m}]} \\frac{1}{m^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{j}\\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right)^{-1} = \\",
