          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:   \\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = -(p + 1). \\]\n   \n   This step involves recognizing the series can be rearranged to take out the $1/k^3$ term which is a harmonic series when considered as a whole. Hence, this gives us the first half of the solution expression.3. Next, we manipulate the double sum $(p - \\frac{1}{2})^{-1}$ to split it into two summands:   \\[(p - \\frac{1}{2})^{-1} = (p-1) + \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2j^2}.\\]4. The first term $(p\u22121)$ has already been calculated and our method shows that $2p > 2$, which leads us to a contradiction if we don't want to make $(p - \\frac{1}{2})^{-1} = (p\u22121) + \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2j^2}$ the entire answer and then claim the rest is simply this expression. 5. Consider the series $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2j^2}$:   \\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2j^2} < \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta(2),\\]   where $\\zeta(2)$ is the Riemann zeta function extended to real numbers at non-positive integers. The sum of a series of reciprocals of squares always converges to a positive, finite value.6. Multiply $p$ by the sum of the series, noting that $\\frac{1}{2}$ is not relevant until after multivariable calculation, we consider:\n\\[2(p-\\frac{1}{2})^2=\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.\\]7. Thus, after consolidating the steps, the expression in terms of $p$ and $q$ is found as:\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = 2p^2 + (p-1)^2.\\]8. Conclusion: The solution to the problem can be presented concisely as follows:\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = 2p^2 + (p-1)^2}\n\\]",
