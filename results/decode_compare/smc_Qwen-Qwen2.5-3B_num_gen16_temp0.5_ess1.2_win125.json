Evelyn: The total distance is 6 miles, and the total time is 10 minutes. To calculate the average speed, we need to convert the time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 10 minutes is equal to 10/60 = 1/6 hours. Now, we can calculate the average speed: average speed = 6 miles / (1/6 hours) = 36 miles per hour.\n\n2. Briana: The total distance is 4 miles, and the total time is 8 minutes. Converting the time to hours, we get 8/60 = 2/15 hours. Now, we can calculate the average speed: average speed = 4 miles / (2/15 hours) = 30 miles per hour.\n\n3. Carla: The total distance is 5 miles, and the total time is 12 minutes. Converting the time to hours, we get 12/60 = 1/5 hours. Now, we can calculate the average speed: average speed = 5 miles / (1/5 hours) = 25 miles per hour.\n\n4. Debra: The total distance is 3 miles, and the total time is 6 minutes. Converting the time to hours, we get 6/60 = 1/10 hours.

Converting the time to hours, we get 4/60 = 1/15 hours.
