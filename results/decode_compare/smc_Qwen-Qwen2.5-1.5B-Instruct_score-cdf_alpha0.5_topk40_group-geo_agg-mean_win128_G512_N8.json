The formula is: \\[(p_1+1)(p_2+1)...(p_n+1)\\], where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ are the distinct prime factors raised to their respective powers.Substituting the primes and their powers from our factorization, we get: \\[(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\].Therefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.The final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

Thus her speed = \\( \\frac{4.5}{0.5} = 9 \\)\n- **Briana**: Briana's speed is the distance she covered divided by the time she took.
