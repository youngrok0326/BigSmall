Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  To convert a point in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to follow three steps:\nStep 1:  The radius (r) is the distance from the origin (0,0) to the point (0,3). To find this, we use the Pythagorean theorem. r = \u221a(coefficient of x)^2 + (coefficient of y)^2\nStep 2: The angle (\u03b8) is the angle between the line connecting the origin with the point in the first quadrant to the point is as follows:\n$\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=\\sqrt{0^{2> <name> <directive> <",
