For each $j$, consider the sum of $\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}$ for all $k$ from 1 to infinity. This is a double sum, but we will focus on how it relates to $p$.Step 2: Recognize that the sum over $k$ for each $j$ is essentially the reciprocal of $j$ times the sum over $k$ of the reciprocal of $k^2$. This is a simple result of the definition of $p$.Step 3: Sum the result from Step 2 from $j = 1$ to infinity. This is a constant sum that corresponds to $p$.Step 4: Apply the result from Step 3 to the constant sum in Step 2. This gives us a contribution of $p$ to the resulting sum.Step 5: Similarly, the sum of $\\frac{1}{k^3}$ for $k$ from 1 to infinity. This is a constant sum that corresponds to $q$.Step 6: Apply the result from Step 5 to the constant sum in Step 4.
