The optimal run of 200 meters is 20 units ahead of going out of bounds. Each student has a different maximum time between running without the rope and running out of bounds. Shirley runs the optimal run before going out of bounds, while Debra runs last.Step 2: Determine the maximum time difference between her optimal Run & out of bounds Run\nIf Rebecca went out of bounds without running, it would be the maximum distance she could run in the time before she could run out of bounds. Since she runs the optimal Run & out of Bounds Run first, she has to run 20 units of time before going out of bounds. Shirley runs the optimal Run first, and she has to run 20 units of time before she can go out of bounds. Therefore, the maximum time difference between Rebecca's optimal Run and Debra's out of bounds Run is 20 units of time.Step 3: Add the time difference between individuals\nThe day before the start, Robert went out of bounds without running, with the optimal run being 20 units ahead of going out of bounds. Reconnect the dots between the individuals for each person in the following equation: Shirley + 20 units of time, Debra + 20 units of time, and Rebecca + 20 units of time.Step 4: Calculate the average speed for each person\nAll this means is: (Shirley + 20 units of time), (Debra + 20 units of time), and (Rebecca + 20 units of time).
