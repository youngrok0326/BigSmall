          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}$.3. The inner circle by itself is a double sum over two interdependent indices: $j$, $k$. Here's a hint to further simplify: $(j, k) = (j, c-j)$ gives $\\frac{1}{j^{3}}$, $k = j$ means $\\frac{1}{j^3}$, which are two cases that need to be summed properly.4. There is a similar double sum described in the outer circle. Compute that as well.5. The outer circle by itself can be written as follows:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j^{3})}= \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}(1-j^2)\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-j^2}\\right)-\\frac{2}{3\\pi }\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{j^{3}}+\\frac{1}{j^{2}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{1-j^{3}}+\\frac{1}{1-j^{2}}. \\]6. Here\u2019s a general idea to simplify the second term in the outer circle:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{j^{3}}+\\frac{1}{j^{2}}\\right)= \\frac{1}{1-c^{3}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2 c^{3}}+\\frac{1}{3 c^{3}}\\right). \\]7. Putting it all together with the integral, we arrive at the first expression in the problem.\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^{3}} = \\int_{c=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1-x^{2/3}}\\,{\\rm d}x - \\int_{c=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\,{\\rm d}x. \\]8. That is the desired result. 9. Thus, $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^{3}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{1-j^{2}}$.10. Concluding that: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^{3}}= H(c),$ where $H(c)$ refers to the second derivative of the $\\ln (sec \\theta)$.11. Simplifying further with the definitions given in the problem. Therefore, substituting $c$ to be our original $p$, we conclude the computation.Therefore, the final answers are: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^{3}} = H(p)$, where $H(p)$ represents the indicated second derivative of $ln(sec\\theta)$.",
