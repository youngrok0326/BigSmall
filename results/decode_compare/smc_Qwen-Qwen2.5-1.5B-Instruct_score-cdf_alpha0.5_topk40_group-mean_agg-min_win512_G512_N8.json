Perform the inner circle ($k$-sum) change of variables: $k = j + t$, then $k = t + 1$. This gives you:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}\n\\]3. Now perform the interchange of the outer and inner circle $t$ and $k$:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+(j+t)^3}\n\\]4. Next, perform the inner circle ($t$-sum) change of variables: $t = j + s$, then $s = s + 1$. This gives you:\\[\n\\sum_{s=0}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+(j+s)^3}\n\\]5.

Now, let's relate the above to $p$ and $q$.- If you take $s = 2$, you get the following:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p - \\left(\\frac{1}{1^2}+\\frac{1}{2^2}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{3^3}+\\ldots \\right) = p-\\frac{4}{\\pi^2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{27}+\\ldots \\right)\n\\]- If you take $s = 1$, you get:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\n\\]- If you take $s = 0$, you get:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p\n\\]Therefore, the sum of the series can be represented as:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2}p\n\\]Consequently, the answer is:\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4\\",
