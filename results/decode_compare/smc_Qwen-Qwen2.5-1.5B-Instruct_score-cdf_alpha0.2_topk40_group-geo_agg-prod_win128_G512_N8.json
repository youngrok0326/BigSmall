For $\\theta$ (in radians):  \n$$ \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) $$Given the point $(0, 3)$, we calculate $r$ and $\\theta$ as follows:For $r$:  \n$$ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $$For $\\theta$:  \n$$ \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) $$However, since $x = 0$, the tangent function is undefined at this point. This indicates that the line on the x-axis is a vertical line, and the point $(0, 3)$ has an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees) with respect to the positive x-axis if we consider the right angle in the counterclockwise direction.Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0, 3)$ are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.Now, let's solve the second part of the problem as requested, where we have to convert $(0, 3)$ to $(r, \\theta)$.For $r$:  \n$$ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $$For $\\theta$:  \n$$ \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) $$The tangent of the angle $\\theta$ would be undefined if we consider the vertical line from the origin in the third or fourth quadrant. However, since we are not asked to consider those quadrants, we will only consider the first quadrant where the angle $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees). Therefore, the new $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.Therefore, the final polar coordinates of the point $(0, 3)$ are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",
