To do this, let $j$ vary from $1$ to $k$, and then $k$ varies from $1$ to $\\infty$. This will allow us to take the inner sum for each $j$, sum the result over $j$, and then take the sum over $k$.Step 2: For the first sum, the inner sum is simply the sum of $\\frac{1}{k^3}$ from $k=1$ to $\\infty$, which is just $q$ (from the problem statement).Step 3: For the second sum, use the result from Step 1 to break it down into two sums, one over $j$ from $1$ to $\\infty$ and one over $k$ from $1$ to $\\infty$. Then take the inner sum over $j$ and $k$ separately.Step 4: Once again, use the result from Step 1 to handle the inner sum. Start by fixing $k$ and letting $j$ vary from $1$ to $k$, and then fix $j$ and letting $k$ vary from $1$ to $\\infty$. Finally, sum the results over $k$, and be sure to divide by $k$ (since the sum is over $k$) to account for the factor of $\\frac{1}{k}$ in each term.Step 5: Finally, combine the results from Steps 2, 3, and 4 to get the desired sum. Sum over $k$ for the first sum (which gives the sum of the second interior sum over $j$ and $k$), then sum over $j$ for the second sum (which gives the sum of the first interior sum over $j$), and finally sum over $k$ for the third sum (which gives the sum of the third interior sum over $k$).Therefore, the final answer is:\\[\\sum_{j = 1, \\, k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{q} \\left( p \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + q \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{p}{2} + \\frac{q}{3} + \\frac{p}{3} + \\frac{q}{3} \\right) \\right).\\]",
