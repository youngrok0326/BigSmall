Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta$.\nThe radius $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point $(0,3)$, which can be found using the distance formula:\n$r = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\nIn this case, $x_1 = 0$, $y_1 = 3$, $x_2 = 0$, and $y_2 = 0$.\n$r = \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = 3$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point $(0,3)$.\nSince the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis, the angle $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n</answer>",
