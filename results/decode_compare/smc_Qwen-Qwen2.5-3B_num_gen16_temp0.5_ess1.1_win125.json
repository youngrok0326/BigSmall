Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta.$\nThe radius $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.$\nIn this case, the point is $(0,3),$ so $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$\nTherefore, $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3.$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.  We can find $\\theta$ using the arctangent function: $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right).$\nIn this case, $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right).$\nSince the point is on the positive y-axis, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2}).$\n</think>\n<answer>\n(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n</answer>\nProblem: Find the value of $x$ in the figure below.\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,10),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8)--(6,8)--(6,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$x^\\circ$\",(1,0),E);\nlabel(\"$115^\\circ$\",(6,0),S);\n[/asy]\nSolution:  <think>\nTo find the value of $x,$ we need to find the measure of the angle labeled $x^\\circ$ in the figure.\nWe can use the fact",

We can rewrite the sum as follows:\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3 + k^3}.\\]\nNow, we can use the fact that $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$ to rewrite the sum in terms of $p$ and $q$.
