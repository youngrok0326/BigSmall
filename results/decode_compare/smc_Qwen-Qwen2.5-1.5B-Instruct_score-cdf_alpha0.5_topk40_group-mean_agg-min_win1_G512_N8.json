          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}$.3. Move this outside the outer circle. Since this term is independent of $j$ and $k$, perform the outer integration next. Let $j$ vary from $1$ to $c-1$. We rewrite thus $-1$ as $-1 \\cdot j$ and $j$ as $j+1$ in the second equal, so that the inner circle sum becomes the inner circle sum $-1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4}... + \\frac{1}{c-1} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x}dx$.4.  Evaluate the result of the outer integration. The integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x}dx = \\ln(x)$ evaluated from $0$ to $1$ gives $\\ln(1) - \\lim_{x\\to 0}\\ln(x)$, and since $\\ln(1) = 0$, we get $\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\ln(x) = -\\infty$.5.  Therefore, the sum becomes $1 + \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x}dx = 1 - \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x}dx \u2208 (-\\infty,1)$.6.  To find $q$, we need an appropriate upper limit. To do this, we use $q = \\int_0^2 \\int_0^3 (1- y- logr)\\quad dy\\quad dx = -\\pi/6$.7.  We also need to find the value of $c$. To do this, we use the following expression: $p= \\int_0^{p} \\frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Hence, we have $p = -\\pi/2$.8.  Finally, put the value of $p = -\\pi/2$ into the solution of $q$. Thus, we have $q = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{5}$.9.  Putting these results together, we get $c = p = -\\pi/2$, and $q = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{5}$10.  Therefore, the value of the result is $c = p$.Therefore, the final answer is $c = p = -{\\pi/2}$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{-{\\pi/2}}$.",
