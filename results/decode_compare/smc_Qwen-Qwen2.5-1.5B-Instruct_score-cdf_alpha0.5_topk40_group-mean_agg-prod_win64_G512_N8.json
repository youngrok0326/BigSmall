Perform the inner circle ($k$-sum) change of variables: $k = j + t$, then $k = t + 1$. This gives you:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}\n\\]3. Rearrange the inner ring to compute from the $t$-sum in the range $0$ to $\\infty$:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+t)^3}\n\\]4. The outer sum (independence of $j$) can now be replaced by a constant:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+t)^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}\n\\]5. Now, for any fixed $t$, one may find:\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}=\\frac{1}{(p+j)^2}\n\\]6. Therefore:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+t)^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}=\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(p+j)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(j+t)^3}\n\\]7.

Therefore the right hand side in the original problem is:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\n\\]9.

This shows that the final result stands raised from the original problem:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}=p\n\\]13. Thus, the final answer is:\\[\n\\boxed{p}\n\\]",
