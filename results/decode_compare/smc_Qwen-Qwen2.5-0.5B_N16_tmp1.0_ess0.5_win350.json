Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  In rectangular coordinates, the point $(0, 3)$ is converted to polar coordinates as follows:\n$r = \\sqrt{a^2 +b^2} = \\sqrt{0^2+3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $\n$\\theta = \\arctan{\\frac{b}{a}} = \\arctan{\\frac{3}{0}}$\n$\\infty \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$\n$r = 3$, $\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi},\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\right)$ i.eStep Solution: 3. Properly convert the rectangular coordinates of the given point to polar coordinates by computing\\theta = \\arctan (3/-3) = -\\frac{\\pi}{3}$! Thus, $(r,\\theta) = (\\sqrt 5, - 1, e ^\n}` \n]\n2. Find x and y as the coordinates of the center of the circle centered at the given point $(0,3)$ through the smallest distance to $(x,}$ radians solutions an easier way to do this is to use a formula.
