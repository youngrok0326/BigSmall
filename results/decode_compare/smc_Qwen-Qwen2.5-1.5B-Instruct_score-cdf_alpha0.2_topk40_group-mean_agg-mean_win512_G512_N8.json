We can reindex the inner sum. Notice that \\(\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) has the same value for each \\(j+k\\) because \\(j+k\\) is just a shifted index. So, let's rewrite the double sum by grouping terms based on the value of \\(j+k\\).Consider the contribution of each \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) to the sum. For each \\(n\\), \\(n\\) can appear in the sums where \\(j+k = n\\). The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\) in the double sum is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\delta_{n, j+k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\delta_{n,j} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\delta_{n,j+k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\delta_{n,j} \\delta_{n,j+1}\\). The Kronecker delta \\(\\delta_{n,j}\\) is 1 if \\(n = j\\), and 0 otherwise.So, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\) in the double sum is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\delta_{n,j} = \\delta_{n,n}\\), where \\(\\delta_{n,j}\\) is 1 if \\(n = j\\), and 0 otherwise. This means the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\) is 1 if \\(n = \\infty\\), and 0 otherwise.Now, we can write the double sum as:\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\delta_{n,n} \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{p}. \\]We also need to consider the contribution of the sum where \\(n < \\infty\\). For these \\(n\\), the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\) is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\delta_{n,j}\\), which is 1 if \\(n = \\infty\\), and 0 otherwise. So, the double sum over these terms is:\n\\[\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q.\\]Therefore, the expression \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{q}{p}\\). Using the definitions of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), we get:\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{p + q}{p} = \\frac{1}{q}.\\]So, the answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{1}{q}}.\\]",
