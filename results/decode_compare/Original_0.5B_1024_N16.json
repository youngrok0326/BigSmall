          "completion": "To solve this problem, we start by finding the derivative of the function with respect to its variable $x$, which is $f'(x)$ in this case. This derivative gives us the slope of the tangent line at any point $x$ on the curve $f(x)$. Next, we evaluate the derivative at $x=-2, x=-1,$ and $x=0$, and then add the three results together to get $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0)$. Using our formulas, we get:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} = \\frac{3(2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. So, using the chain rule, we can write: $f(x) = \\frac{3^x - 2^x}{x - 2}$. At the point of interest, we want to evaluate the function $f(x)$. Let's start by evaluating $f(x)$ at $x=-2$, which gives us $f(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2$. Next, we evaluate $f(x)$ at $x=-1$, which gives us $f(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-5}{-4} = \\frac{5}{4}$. Lastly, we evaluate $f(x)$ at $x=0$, which gives us $f(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{0 - 2}{-2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1$. Now, we can summarize our evaluations and the final answer: $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{4} + 1 = \\frac{13}{4}$. \ud83e\udd14\n.IContainerYib\n'system\nSolve the following math problem efficiently and clearly:\n\n- For simple problems (2 steps or fewer):\nProvide a concise solution with minimal explanation.\n\n- For complex problems (3 steps or more):\nUse this step-by-step format:\n\n## Step 1: [Concise description]\n[Brief explanation and calculations]\n\n## Step 2: [Concise description]\n[Brief explanation and calculations]\n\n...\n\nRegardless of the approach, always conclude with:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{answer}$.
