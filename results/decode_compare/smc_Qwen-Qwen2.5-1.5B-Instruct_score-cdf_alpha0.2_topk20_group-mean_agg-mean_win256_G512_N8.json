We can interchange the order of the double sum and the infinite series.

Now we are looking at a new infinite sum inside. Let's define $s_k = q$, thus we have $s_k = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$. 4. We now use these definitions to get our desired sum, rewrite it as follows:\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty s_k$$5.
