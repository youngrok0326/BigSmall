We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$Here, we have a two-step approach:(i) First, we rearrange the terms, bringing $k = j + m$ where $m$ is a dummy variable, making the expression look like $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{m = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+m)^3}$.(ii) Next, we factor out a dummy variable, $m$, but keep the sum as $r = j + m$ for further simplification to $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{r = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{r^3}$.3. Now, we proceed by moving to the double sum $\\sum_{r = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{r^3}$:$\\sum_{r = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{r^3} = \\frac{1}{p}$. Therefore, the expression is simplified to $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\frac{1}{p} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{r = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{r^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{r = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{r^3} = \\frac{q}{p}$.4. Recalling that $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2} = p$ and $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} = q$.3. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{q}{p}$.
