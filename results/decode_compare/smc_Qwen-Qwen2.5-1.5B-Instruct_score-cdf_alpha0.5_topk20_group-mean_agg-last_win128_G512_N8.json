          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:   \\begin{align*}\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} &= \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + j+k)^3}\\\\\n   &= \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + j+k)^3}.\n   \\end{align*}3. Shift the index for simplicity, letting $l = j + k$. Then, consider $l \\ge 2$ (since $j \\ge 1$, which means that $j = 1$ yields $l \\ge 2$). This results in:   \\begin{align*}\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} &= \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\sum_{l = k}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + l)^3}\\\\\n   &= \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + k)^3}\\sum_{l = k}^\\infty 1.\n   \\end{align*}4. From step 3, we express $\\sum_{l = k}^\\infty 1$ as an integral, as in (a passage from wiki), yielding:   \\begin{align*}\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} &= \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + k)^3}\\int_{k}^\\infty dx\\\\\n   &= \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + k)^3}\\int_{k}^\\infty dx\\\\\n   &= \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + k)^3}(x)_{x = k}^{x = \\infty}\\\\\n   &= \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + k)^3}\\int_{k}^\\infty dx.\n   \\end{align*}5. Define $R = \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + k)^3}\\int_{k}^\\infty dx$, $S = \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + k)^3}$ and work out:\n   \\begin{align*}\n   R &= \\int_{0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(-p + x)^3}\\int_{x}^\\infty dx\\\\\n   &= \\int_{0}^\\infty\\int_{x}^\\infty x e^{-p x} dx\\\\\n   &= \\int_{0}^\\infty x e^{-p x} dx.\n   \\end{align*}6. To compute the inner integral $R$, we switch to the variable $t$ in $x$, so $dx = dt/ \\ln(t)$. Note that taking infinity as the limit of $t$ (which is the natural logarithm base), it results in the infinity. Therefore, we have:   \\begin{align*}\n   R &= \\int_{0}^\\infty x e^{-p x} dx = \\int_{0}^\\infty x e^{-p x}\\frac{dt}{\\ln(t)}\\\\\n   &= \\int_{0}^\\infty x e^{-p x}dt,\n   \\end{align*}7. Therefore, verify the step:   \\begin{align*}\n   S &= p + R\\\\\n   &= p + 2\\int_{0}^\\infty x e^{-p x}\\frac{dt}{\\ln(t)}.\n   \\end{align*}8. Now, substitute $t$ back",
