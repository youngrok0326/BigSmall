Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta$.\nThe radius $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, where $x$ and $y$ are the rectangular coordinates.\nIn this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, so $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ can be found using the formula $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the rectangular coordinates.\nIn this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, so $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$.\nSince the tangent of an angle is undefined when the denominator is zero, we need to consider the special case when $x = 0$.\nIn this case, the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive $y$-axis, so the angle $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n</think>\n2. <answer>\n$(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$\n</answer>",
