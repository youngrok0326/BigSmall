Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta.$\nThe radius $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.$\nIn this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3,$ so $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3.$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.  We can find this angle using the arctangent function: $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right).$\nIn this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3,$ so $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right).$\nHowever, the arctangent function only returns values between",
