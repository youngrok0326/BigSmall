          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[c = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{((j + k) + (k) - (j))^{3}}\\right) = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{((k)^{3}(j + k)^{3})}\\right).\\]3. Next, we make a change of index in the sum-to-integrate by setting $k = m + n$. For all $k, m, n, j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$, there exist finitely many values of $m$ and $n$ such that $k = m + n$. Furthermore, each $m$ and $n$ is uniquely determined by $k$, $m$, $n$, and $j$.4. After evaluating the infinite sum, we have:\\[c = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{((k)^{3}(m + n)^{3})}.\\]5. Breaking it into single sums, we obtain:\\begin{align*}\nc &= \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(m+n)^3}\\right). \n\\end{align*}6. Since $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(m+n)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(m+k)^3}$,\n\\[c = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(m+n)^3}.\\]7. Simplifying further, we have:\\begin{align*}\nc &= \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\left(\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(m+n)^3}\\right).\n\\end{align*}8. We then set $\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(m+n)^3}$ equal to $q$.9. Thus, the sum becomes:\\begin{align*}\nc &= \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}(q).\n\\end{align*}10. Since $p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$, we can write:\\[c = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}q.\\]11. Therefore, the final answer is:\\[c = pq.\\]Conclusion:\nThus, for the given problem, we have:\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = pq. \\]This conclusion has been reached by systematically breaking down the problem, manipulating the series, and employing algebraic identities.
