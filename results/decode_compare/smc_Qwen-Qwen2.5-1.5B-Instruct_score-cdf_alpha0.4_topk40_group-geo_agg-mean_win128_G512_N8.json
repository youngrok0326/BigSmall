          "completion": "To convert the rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we use the following formulas:1. $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ (for the distance from the origin to the point)\n2. $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$ (for the angle from the positive x-axis to the point, projected onto the positive x-axis by the right-hand rule)For the given rectangular coordinates $(0, 3)$:1. Calculate $r$:\\[ r = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\]2. Calculate $\\theta$:\\[ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) \\]Since the x-coordinate is zero, the point lies on the y-axis. The arctangent of a value divided by zero indicates that the angle is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees) up from the x-axis, or $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ radians (270 degrees) if measured clockwise.Therefore, the final answer is:$r = 3$, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.In rectangular coordinates, the point $(0, 3)$ is on the positive y-axis, hence it's a unique polar form $(r, \\theta) = (3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ regardless of its direction. This is because in a polar coordinate system, one direction (e.g., $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$) is more suitable for the given point due to its position relative to the positive y-axis. Therefore, for this problem, the final answer does not change from its initial polar form $(r, \\theta)$ where $r = 3$. Therefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration second. Now, the outer circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.4. By applying constrained integration variables, we get that: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3} = c-\\frac{1}{(c-1)^2}-\\frac{1}{(c-2)^2}-\\frac{1}{(c-3)^2}-...$.5. Note that the above expression matches the double sum from the book problem with $p$ and $q$.6. Reassigning the variable back, we proceed to express the above double sum. So, $c-c+1 -\\frac{1}{(c-1)^2} - \\frac{1}{(c-2)^2} -\\frac{1}{(c-3)^2} - ...= \\frac{1}{c-1}-(\\frac{1}{c-2}-\\frac{1}{c-1})-...$, which does not match the expression.7. Let's correct this mistake. The inner circle should be $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(j+c)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^2}$, not $\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$ as previously calculated.8. Next, integrate the inner circle. By applying constrained integration, we get the double sum as $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^2}$.9. Perform the final integration. Combining the results:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = c - \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+c)^2}\n\\]10. Since \n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+c)^2} = \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{(c+1)^2}+\\frac{1}{(c+2)^2}+ \\frac{1}{(c+3)^2} + ...\\tag{1}\n\\]11. The book has $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+c)^2} = \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{(c+1)^2}+\\frac{1}{(c+2)^2} + \\frac{1}{(c+3)^2} +...+\\frac{1}{c^2}$. We have the correction.12. Substitute the corrected double sum from 11 into the book answer $p+q = 1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{16} + ... = \\frac{5}{2}$. 13. Therefore, $p+q = \\frac{5}{2}$. 14. Hence, $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = c - \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+c)^2}$, confirming the final answer.Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$.",
