Calculation for $\\theta$: \n\\[\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)\\]The tangent of 0 is 0, but because we are treating 0 as the projection of the x-axis onto our device (right-hand rule), we take into account that the point $(0,3)$ lies on the y-axis. Thus, when rotating from the positive x-axis, it comes exactly on the right side of origin, hence:\n\\[\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\] (considering it's an immediately right angle due to clockwise rotation from positive x-axis given $x=0$ and origin, $(0,3)$ is clearly above the $x$-axis in the Cartesian plane)Therefore, the rectangular point $(0,3)$ in the polar coordinates is:\n\\[\\boxed{(\\sqrt{9},\\arctan(\\frac{3}{0}))}\\]\n\\[\\boxed{(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\]",

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$$K = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}=\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.$$\n   \n3. Next, we interchange the order of summation and take into account that $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ maintains the same sum for all $j$ because the summand is identical to the original double sum. Hence, we get the following equation:$$K = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k+1)^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.$$\n   \n4. Notice that the sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ is a re-indexing of our original double sum with the index 'j' shifted to 'k'. So, whenever 'j' increases by 1, 'k' also increases by 1 too. Thus, due to this transformation, the sum over 'j' will equal the sum over 'k' and hence sums into the same value:$$K = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k+1)^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k+1)^3} \\cdot \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.$$5. From the step above, it becomes evident that each term is repeated twice due to the notation. Therefore, we cancel out the repeated terms to get:$$K = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k+1)^3} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}.$$\n   \n6. Now we recognize that this becomes a short-hand notation for $p$ along with the terms as simply stated here:$$K = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3}.$$7. We then re-index $K$ such that $j$ is substituted for $j - 1$ and plugging in:$$K = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} \\cdot \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}$$.8. Reading off $q$ from above, $p$ is $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}$, we notice that replacing $p$ with $q$ in place of $p$ will yield:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3}\\frac{1}{(j + 2)^3}\\cdots\\frac{1}{(j + n)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k = n}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.$$9. By substituting $q$ as $p$, this leads to:$$K = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k+1)^3} \\cdot \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3} \\cdot \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}.$$10. Since $p$ is equivalent to $q$, we can conclude that:$$\\",
