Given the distances and running times, we can infer:\n- Evelyn: Runs 4.5 units of distance in 10 minutes.\n- Briana: Runs 2.2 units of distance in 12 minutes.\n- Carla: Runs 5.2 units of distance in 18 minutes.\n- Debra: Runs 2.8 units of distance in 20 minutes.\n- Angela: Runs 1.4 units of distance in 14 minutes.### Step 2: Calculate Average Time\nNext, we calculate the average time each student takes to complete the run.For each student, the average time can be calculated by dividing the total time by the total distance (e.g., total distance divided by total time).#### Simulations:\nAfter calculations:\n- **Evelyn**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{4.5}{10 \\text{ minutes}}\n  \\]\n- **Briana**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2.2}{12 \\text{ minutes}}\n  \\]\n- **Carla**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{5.2}{18 \\text{ minutes}}\n  \\]\n- **Debra**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2.8}{20 \\text{ minutes}}\n  \\]\n- **Angela**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{1.4}{14 \\text{ minutes}}\n  \\]### Conclusion:\nTo determine who has the greatest average speed, compare the calculated average speeds for each student.The final answer should be:Therefore, the student with the greatest average speed is (Evelyn).So, the final answer is: $\\boxed{Evelyn}$.",
