          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.\n    \\]3. Next, we perform a change of variables and a shift in the first index to rewrite the notation and eliminate some distributional terms:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k+j)^3}.\n    \\]4. Here we let $i = k + j$ with the condition that $1 \\leq i$ due to the initial sum's variable range. This simplifies to a more explicit replacement of indices $i$ instead of $k$:    \\[\n    \\sum_{i, j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k+i)^3} \\rightarrow \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k+i)^3}.\n    \\]5. Now we interchange the order of summation:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i+j)^3}.\n    \\]6. Notice that the new innermost sum can be rewritten as:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i+j)^3} = \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i)^3} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i+j)^2}.\n    \\]7. Using $c$ again, we express the inner sum by $c$:    \\[\n    \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i+j)^2} = \\frac{1}{c} \\int_c^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(i+x)^3} dx.\n    \\]8. Substitute back:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c} \\int_c^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(i+x)^3} dx.\n    \\]9. The integral is convergent and thus its series representation equals the remaining part of the sum:    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{c} \\int_c^{\\infty} \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i + x)^3} dx = \\frac{1}{c} g(c).\n    \\]10. Thus, the resulting infinite sum is expressed in terms of $c$ and the function $g$.11. So, we express $g(c)$ as:    \\[\n    c = \\frac{1}{c} g(c).\n    \\]12. Hence, we have $g(c) = c$ for $c \\geq 1$. Therefore, we obtain:    \\[\n    g(c) = \\frac{1}{p}.\n    \\]13. Putting it together, now we express the desired infinite sum:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i+j)^3} = \\frac{c}{g(c)} = \\frac{1}{p}.\n    \\]14. Additionally, we note $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(i+j)^3} = \\frac{1}{i^3}g\\left(\\frac{i}{c}\\right) = \\frac{1}{i^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{p} \\int_c^{i/c} \\frac{1}{x^3} dx$.15. Finally, the last result can be expressed as:    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i^3} = \\gamma - \\frac{1}{p}",
