Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  <think>\nTo convert from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we use the following equations:\n$$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$$\nFor the point (0,3), we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3$.  Plugging these values into the equations, we get:\n$$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$$\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\nTherefore, the point $(0,3)$ in polar coordinates is $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n</answer>\nThe following is a multiple-choice question. 1. Choose the correct answer.\nGiven that  $\\triangle ABC$  is isosceles with  $AB=AC$ ,  $D$  lies on  $ \\overline{AC}$  such that  $BD$  bisects  $\\angle ABC$ , and  $E$  lies on  $ \\overline{AC}$  such that  $DE\\perp BD$ , compare the lengths of  $DE$  and  $DC$  by a step-by-step chain of valid equivalences. (We allow for the possibility that one length can be larger than the other or they can be the same length.)\nTo compare the lengths of \\(DE\\) and \\(DC\\), we will analyze the given isosceles triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with \\( AB = AC \\), and the points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) on \\( \\overline{AC} \\). We will use the given information that \\( BD \\) bisects \\( \\angle ABC \\) and \\( DE \\perp BD \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the given information\n- \\( AB = AC \\) (isosceles triangle)\n- \\( BD \\) bisects \\( \\angle ABC \\)\n- \\( DE \\perp BD \\)\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the angle bisector and perpendicularity\n- Since \\( BD \\) bisects \\( \\angle ABC \\), \\( \\angle ABD = \\angle DBC \\).\n- \\( DE \\perp BD \\) means that \\( DE \\) is perpendicular to \\( BD \\).\n\n### Step 3: Using the Angle Bisector Theorem\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides:\n\\[ \\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Considering the Perpendicular Condition\nSince \\( DE \\perp BD \\), \\( \\triangle BDE \\) is a right triangle. Let \\( \\theta \\) be the angle \\( \\angle ABD \\).\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the right triangle \\( \\triangle BDE \\)\n- \\( \\angle BDE = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) (since \\( DE \\perp BD \\))\n- \\( \\angle DBC = \\theta \\) (since \\( BD \\) bisects \\( \\angle ABC \\))\n- \\( \\angle DBE = \\pi - \\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\)\n\n### Step 6: Using Trigonometric Ratios\nIn \\( \\triangle BDE \\):\n\\[ DE = BD \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\\[ BE = BD \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\n### Step 7: Comparing \\( DE \\) and \\( DC \\)\nWe need to compare \\( DE \\) and \\( DC \\):\n\\[ DE = BD \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\\[ DC = AD + DC - AD = AD + (AC - AD) = AC - AD = AB - AD \\]\n\n### Step 8: Using the Angle Bisector Theorem\n\\[ \\frac{AD}{DC} = \\",
