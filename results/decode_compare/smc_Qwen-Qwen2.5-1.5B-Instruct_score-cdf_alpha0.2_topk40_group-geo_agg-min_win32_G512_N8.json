          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}$.3. Now, perform the outer circle $j$ integration first. Define $\\frac{r}{c-j}$ as $r$. Then the outer circle is $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{r}{c}r^{-r} = r^2\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}r^{-j}$. 4. Let $\\frac{1}{c-j} = b$, so $j = c - b$. Now we have $b$ ranging between $1$ and $c-1$. The inner circle transforms the double sum as $\\sum_{b=1}^{c-1}r^{c-b}(1-r)^{-b}$.5. Define $y = r^{c-b}$, then $[y,1;1+b,b]$. This part of the double sum is thus equal to $\\sum_{b=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(1+b)(1-r)^b} = \\frac{1}{1-r}\\sum_{b=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{b}}$.6. We rewrite the above sum using an integral: $\\frac{1}{1-r}\\int_0^{1}\\frac{1}{1+x}\\sum_{b=1}^{\\infty} x^{-b}\\; dx$. 7. As $b$ is replaced by $z$, which leads to the series converging, it can be integrated term by term into a geometric series. Hence, we have $\\frac{1}{1-r}\\int_0^{1}(1+x)^{-z}\\; dz$. 8. Solve the integral: $-\\log[(1+x)/2]$. Incorporate this back into the double sum, we get $-\\log[r \\cdot (1+\\frac{1}{c-b})^{1-b}/2]$. 9. Substitute this with $r = 1/q$, we get $\\log[2^{-1-b}/(1-q^{c-b})]$.10. Substitute $1-b$ with $1-c+b$, we then have $\\log[2^{c-b}/(1-q^{c-b}(c-b))]$. As $\\sum_{b=1}^{c-1}q^{x} = \\frac{q-c+1}{1-q}$, we simplify further to $\\log[2^{c-b}\\frac{c-b}{2^{c-b}q-c+1}]$.11. Substitute $c = p$ into the above expression, we end up with $\\log\\left[ 2^{1-p-b} \\frac{p-b}{2^p} \\right]$.12. As $p = \\sum_{b=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{b}$, rearranging the above expression yields $1-p-b = 1-p-\\log \\frac{1}{p}$.13. The final result can be written as $\\log [1-\\frac{1}{2^{1-p^{-1}}}]\\frac{1}{2^{1-p^{-1}}}$.14. As $\\sum_{b=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{b} = \\log \\frac{1}{p}$, which matches our expectation, it follows that $p^{-1}$ is added as $b$ is distributed.15. After reorganizing the above expression, we have $\\frac{\\log [1 - \\frac{1}{2^{1-p^{-1}}}]}{2^{1-p^{-1}}}$. 16. Similarly, we observe that $q^{-1}$ is consistently added in the expression for $q$.17. Substituting this back into the original expression for the double sum yields $\\frac{\\log [1 - \\frac{1}{2^{1-q^{-1}}}] \\frac{1}{2^{1-q^{-1}}}}{\\log [1 -",

However, for this problem, we will just focus on the distances and infer the average time from the shape of the graph if necessary.For the sake of this problem, we will assume the total time is a constant and focus on the distance.### Step 2: Calculate Average Speed\n- Evelyn's Average Speed: \\( \\frac{4.5 \\text{ units}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\) (We assume the time is the same for all as they are on the same plane or relative to each other, and focus on the distance provided as the key metric for speed across the journey.)\n- Briana's Average Speed: \\( \\frac{2.2 \\text{ units}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\)\n- Carla's Average Speed: \\( \\frac{5.2 \\text{ units}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\)\n- Debra's Average Speed: \\( \\frac{2.8 \\text{ units}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\)\n- Angela's Average Speed: \\( \\frac{1.4 \\text{ units}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\)Since we only have the distances and no specific time, we need to assume a common total time for ease of comparison.
