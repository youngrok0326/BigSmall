Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  <think>First, the AI needs to recall the formula for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The formula for converting a point $(x,y)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates is $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{y}{x})$. The AI now needs to plug in the values $x = 0$ and $y = 3$ into the formula to find the polar coordinates. The AI recalls that when $x = 0$, the formula for $\\theta$ is undefined and needs to find another way to find $\\theta$ in this case. The AI realizes that the point is located on the positive $y$-axis and that $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The AI is now ready to calculate $r$ by plugging $x = 0$ and $y = 3$ into the formula for $r$ and conclude with the answer. </think>\n<answer>\nr = 3, theta = pi/2\n</answer>\nProblem: Find \\[\\cos \\left( {\\cos }^{-1} \\frac{4}{5} + \\tan }^{-1} 3 \\right).\\]\nSolution:  <think>The angle is of the form $\\cos^{-1} a + \\tan^{-1} b$, so the angle is in Quadrant I. If the angle is in Quadrant I, then $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ are both positive. Using the angle addition formula for sine, we find \\[\\sin(\\cos^{-1} a + \\tan^{-1} b) = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2} a + \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2} b.\\]Since $\\cos^2$ and $\\sin^2$ add up to $1$, the value of $\\cos^2$ is $\\frac{25}{34}$ and the value of $\\cos$ is $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{34}}$. The value of $\\sin$ is $\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{34}}.$Or, we could let $a = \\cos^{-1} \\frac{4}{5}$ and $b = \\tan^{-1} 3$ and find \\[\\cos(a + b) = \\cos a \\cos b - \\sin a \\sin b,\\]using the angle addition formula for cosine.</think>\n<answer>\\frac{1}{65}</answer>\nProblem: Two circles of radius $r$ are externally tangent to each other and internally tangent to the ellipse $x^2 + 4y^2 = 4$ as shown.
