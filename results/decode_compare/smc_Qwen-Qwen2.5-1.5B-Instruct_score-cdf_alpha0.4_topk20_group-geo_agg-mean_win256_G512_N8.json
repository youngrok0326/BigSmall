Consider the inner sum as a function of \\(j\\):\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\]We can simplify the sum over \\(k\\) inside the inner sum by reindexing the variable. Let \\(m = j + k\\), then as \\(k\\) goes from 1 to \\(\\infty\\), \\(m\\) also goes from \\(j\\) to \\(\\infty\\). So we can rewrite the inner sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{m=j}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) now runs from \\(j\\) to \\(\\infty\\).Substituting this back into the outer sum, we get:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=m}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}\n\\]Now, we need to understand how many terms contribute to the inner sum. For each \\(m\\) (which ranges from \\(1\\) to \\(\\infty\\)), the number of terms \\(k\\) ranges from \\(m\\) to \\(\\infty\\).Thus, the double sum can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=m}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=m}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}\n\\]We can sum \\(\\frac{1}{m^3}\\) over all \\(k\\) from \\(m\\) to \\(\\infty\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=m}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} = \\frac{1}{m^3} \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}\n\\]So we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=m}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}\n\\]\\[\n= \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right)^2\n\\]We recognize that the double sum evaluates to:\n\\[ \\left( q \\right)^2 \\]Thus, the expression can be written in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) as:\n\\[ \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\right) = q^2 \\]Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{q^2}\n\\]",
