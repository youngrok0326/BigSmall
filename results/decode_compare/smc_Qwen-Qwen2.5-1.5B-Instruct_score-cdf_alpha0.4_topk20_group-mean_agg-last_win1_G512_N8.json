          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:   $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (\\frac{1}{j + k})$3. The double sum is split into the same pieces for $j$, and we have:   $\\sum_{i = 2}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty (\\frac{1}{i})\\cdot (\\frac{1}{i-j})$4. By splitting up $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+i)}$, we have to use partial fraction decomposition:   $\\sum_{i = 2}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i}( \\int_{\\frac{1}{i}}^{1}(\\frac{1}{k})\\,dk)$5. Performing the anti-derivative, we get the integral:   $\\sum_{i = 2}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i}( \\ln(\\frac{1}{k}))$6. Switching the sum and integral, we have:   $\\sum_{i = 2}^\\infty\\int_{\\frac{1}{i}}^{1}(\\frac{1}{i})\\,dk$7. Evaluating the integral, the right-hand sum becomes $1 - \\frac{1}{i}$, and we see $1 - \\frac{1}{i}$ converges.8. Therefore, the double sum $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ converges.9. Comparing it to the double sum we find that,    $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{p^2}$.10. Also, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} = \\frac{1}{q^2}$.11. Therefore, the sum is     $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{p^2} \\bullet \\frac{1}{q^2}$. 12. In conclusion,\\[q^2 = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\cdot qp\\]So, the formula is $\\frac{1}{p^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{q^2} = \\frac{1}{p^2} \\cdot (qp)$.Therefore, the resulting expression $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{p^2}{q^2}}$.",
