          "completion": "To convert the rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we use the following formulas:1. $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ (for the distance from the origin to the point)\n2. $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$ (for the angle from the positive x-axis to the point, projected onto the positive x-axis by the right-hand rule)where $\\arctan(\\frac{y}{x})$ gives the exact angle in radians for a point (x, y) in the first quadrant, but $\\theta$ can be positive or negative depending on the quadrant.For the given point $(x, y) = (0, 3)$, we see that the x-coordinate is 0, which means the line is on an axis, not an angle. Therefore, the length of the line segment is simply the y-coordinate, which is 3. This means that at an angle of $0$ (the y-axis), we have the same x-coordinate. However, we can extend the line to be positive or negative infinity to satisfy our conditions for $r > 0$.However, the point $(0, 3)$ is ultimately considered on the y-axis itself, since it's the maximum distance away from the y-axis's 0-angle axis. So, the exact distance from this point to the y-axis is 3 units.Thus, for a point $(0, 3)$, $r$ and $\\theta$ are both 3.Therefore, $r = 3$ and $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$.However, in the context of a point, we can conclude the $\\theta$ is in the first or fourth quadrant because of the point itself which has no other suitable location for an angle other than y-axis, which is undefined for calculations like $\\arctan$ here.So, since this point is on the y-axis: $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $r$ is $3$.Therefore, our final coordinates in polar form are:$r = 3$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$,Therefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[ = \\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]\n\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\\]3. We now switch the order of summation in the inner sum:\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\\]4. We can further simplify the inner sum by noting that for each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the inner sum is:\\[ \\sum_{\\substack{j\\ge1\\\\j\\equiv k\\pmod{k+1}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} + \\sum_{\\substack{j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\\\j\\equiv k\\pmod{k}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{\\substack{j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\\\j\\neq k\\pmod{k}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\\]5. Using step 2, we can express the sum in step 2 as:\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}.\\]6. This leads us to conclude that:\\[ \\sum_{\\substack{j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\\\j\\neq k\\pmod{k}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{q}{k^3}\\]7. Thus, the sum can be approximated as:\\[ \\sum_{\\substack{j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\\\j\\neq k\\pmod{k}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{q}{k^3}.\\]8. Therefore, we can conclude that:\\[\\sum_{\\substack{j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\\\j\\neq k\\pmod{k}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{q}{k^3}.\\]9. By recognizing that $p = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^2}$, we can express $\\frac{q}{k^3}$ as:\\[\\frac{q}{k^3} = \\frac{q}{k^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{q}{k^5} = \\frac{q}{k^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{q}{k^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{q}{k^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k^2}.\\]10. Hence, we can conclude that:\\[\\sum_{\\substack{j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\\\j\\neq k\\pmod{k}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{q}{k^3}.\\]11. Therefore, we have the expression:\\[\\sum_{\\substack{j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\\\j\\neq k\\pmod{k}}}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{q}{k^3}.\\]12. Thus, the final answer is:\\[ \\boxed{\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{q}{k^3}}. \\]",
