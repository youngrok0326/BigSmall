          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration second. Now, the outer circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.4. For $j = 1$ (first case) and $j \\geq 2$ (next cases), we have the following expression for the outer circumference:   - For $j \\geq 2$: $(j+c)^{-3}(\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}k)$.\n   - For $j=1$: $(j+c)^{-3}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}k$.5. Simplify the expression as follows:\n   - For the first case: $(j+c)^{-3}(\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}k)$\n   - For the second case: $(j+c)^{-3}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}k = -\\frac{1}{(c-j)^4}$ (1)   Therefore, the outer circle $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}(j+c)^{-3}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}k+j+c = [-\\frac{1}{(c-j)^4}](c-j)+c$ from the $j \\geq 2$ case6. Note that from this doubled sum of the inner circle, we realize that $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ is actually equivalent to $\\frac{1}{(j+c-(j))^{3}}$ due to variable relabelling and summation adjustment.7. Hence, we have: $\\sum_{j,k=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = -\\frac{1}{(c-j)^4} + \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}$.8. After simplifying the double sum of the inner circle to the sum of the outer circles for equal sum cases:\n    - $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3} = -\\frac{1}{(c-j)^4} + (-\\sum_{k=1}^kc^{-3})$9. For the last step, we attach the outer summation for $j \\geq 2$ and the outer summation for $j \\leq c-2$ (as the $j = 1$ case is negligible in comparison to the outer sum).10. Therefore, we have the final result:    $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1} \\sum_{k=1}^{c-j} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = -\\frac{1}{(c-j)^4} + \\sum_{k=1}^c\\frac{1}{k^3}$ (2)Thus, the sum can be expressed as:\n$\\boxed{p - q}$.",
