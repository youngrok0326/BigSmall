          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + j)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$3. We then rewrite the double sum in a more convenient form:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{j}{k}}$$4. After further manipulation of the double sum, we can rearrange the sum so that the fraction $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ is on the outside of the sum and $-\\frac{k}{(k-j)(k-j+1)}$ is on the inside of the sum. This yields:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$$5. The final step is to notice that the inner sum can be written as a Mangoldt function sum:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$$6. Substitute back $c$ to get:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}$$7. Using this result, we can now express the given sum in terms of p and q:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3} = \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{q}{j^3}$$8. Finally, we can write it as:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{q}{p}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}$$9. The last sum can be expressed in terms of the zeta function:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3} = \\zeta(3)$$10. Substitute back:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{q}{p}\\zeta(3)$$11. The final answer for the above is:$$\\boxed{\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty",
