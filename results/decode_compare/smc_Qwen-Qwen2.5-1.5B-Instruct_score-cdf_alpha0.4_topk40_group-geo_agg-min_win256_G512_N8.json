          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Now perform the outer circle ($j$) integration. There are two cases here: when $j+1 \\le k$ and when $j < k$. We'll integrate over $j$ and $k$ in all those cases separately.4. We've now achieved a non-reducible expression for both $p$ and $q$.5. Let's integrate over $j$ first: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3} = j\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$.6. Now let's integrate over $k$: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{c+j}{(c-j)^2}$.7. Do the same integration over $j$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^2}$.8. Finally, let's integrate the double sum of 7). We get $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left[j\\frac{1}{(c-1-j)^3 + 1} + (c-j)\\frac{1}{(c-j)^2}\\right]$.9. For the case $j + 1 \\le k$, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3} = c \\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{k^2} = cp$.10. From the second case of integration in step 6, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^2} = \\sum_{k=1}^{c}\\frac{1}{k^2} = q$.11. Now, applying these results to double sum in step 4, we get $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left[c\\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-1-j)^3} + (c-j)\\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^2}\\right]$.12. We can finally express this non-reducible expression in terms of $p$ and $q$, representing $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left[j\\frac{1}{(c-1-j)^3} + (c-j)\\frac{1}{(c-j)^2}\\right] = c\\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-1-j)^3} + (c-j)\\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^2} = f(p,q)$.13. Finally, the function $f(p,q)$ obtained in step 12 will give us the required expression.In conclusion, the final answer is $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left[j\\frac{1}{(c-1-j)^3} + (c-j)\\frac{1}{(c-j)^2}\\right] = f(p,q)$.\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{f(p,q)}$.",
