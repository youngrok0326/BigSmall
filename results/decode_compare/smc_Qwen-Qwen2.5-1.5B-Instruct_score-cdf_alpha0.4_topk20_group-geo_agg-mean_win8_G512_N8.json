We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(2\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} - \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+2k)^3}\\right). $$3.

Substituting this back into our original expression:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} + 2\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} - \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} - \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.$$6. Simplifying, we get:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = 2p.$$7. We need to find a way to express $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ in terms of $p$ and $q$. We start by removing the summations in $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\right).$$8. Using the definition of $q$ and $p$, we get:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\right) = 2q.$$Therefore, we have:\\begin{align*",

          "answer": "9",
          "completion": "## Step 1: Prime factorization of 196\nTo find the number of divisors, we'll first need to find the prime factorization of 196.196 can be factored into prime numbers as: $196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2$.## Step 2: Determine the number of divisors\nFor any number expressed in the form $p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\cdots \\times p_n^{a_n}$, the total number of divisors is given by $(a_1 + 1) \\times (a_2 + 1) \\times \\cdots \\times (a_n + 1)$.Given our prime factorization of 196 ($2^2 \\times 7^2$), we can calculate the number of divisors as follows:\n- For the first prime factor 2: $a_1 = 2$. So $(2 + 1) \\times$ (number of divisors for the second factor) = $3$.\n- For the second prime factor 7: $a_2 = 2$. Now multiply by $(2 + 1)$.Therefore, the total number of divisors is: $3 \\times 3 = 9$.But wait! We must not forget, we're only considering positive whole numbers.Let's double-check: The divisors of 196 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, and 196, as per the prime factorization.Since the sequence starts from 1 (as per the question), we include 1 in our count of divisors, which breaks the rationale just until now.However, since the question specifies whole-number divisors only, and 1 was indeed generated by 196's prime factors, including it maintains the formation of divisor sets.So, counting back to ensure my calculation was correct: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Only 1 was omitted as the least divisor, indicating it was not counted as relevant.Therefore, the total number of whole-number divisors is indeed 9.There was an internal inconsistency in the initial interpretation of the divisors. Following clarifying guidelines, I reiterate: 1. To find the number of divisors of $196$, start by factoring it into primes ($196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2$).\n2. Use the formula for total divisors: $(a_1 + 1) \\times (a_2 + 1)$ where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the exponents of prime factors, respectively.\n3. Manually list out the divisors to verify before concluding with the corrected count. With correct emphasis on positive divisors, upon recounting, the number of divisors remains 9.
