Rectangles cannot be solid in 3D space, often visualized as lines. Rectangles are two-dimensional shapes and the formula for $r$ is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, which will always be positive. When converting the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we should expect $r$ to be positive. However, since the $x$-coordinate is zero, the point $(0, 3)$ lies on the positive $y$-axis. This means that the distance from the origin to the point is $3$, making $r = 3$.2. $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$If we were to calculate $\\arctan(3)$, we would get approximately $1. 249$ radians.

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration second. Now, the outer circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.4. The inner sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(c-j-k)^3}$ can be reindexed with $l = k - 1$, then $l$ can be written as $1$ for $k=1$. Thus, the outer circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{l=0}^{c-2}\\frac{(l+1)+c}{(c-l)^3}$.5. This double sum is called a signed harmonic sum, which can be computed using the Euler function, making the double sum equal to $\\sum_{l=0}^{c-2}\\frac{(l+1)}{(c-l)^3} + \\sum_{l=0}^{c-2}\\frac{(l+1)}{(l+1)^3}$.6. Let $s = 1 + Q$. Then, we have transformed the double sum to a triple sum: $\\sum_{l=0}^{c-2}h\\left(\\frac{1}{l+1}\\right)\\frac{s}{s^3} = \\frac{1}{s^3}\\sum_{l=0}^{c-2}\\frac{1}{l+1}\\text{sign}\\left(\\frac{1}{l+1}\\right)$.7. Expanding the sign term, this becomes $\\frac{1}{s^3}\\sum_{l=0}^{c-2}(-1)^{l+1}\\frac{1}{l+1}$.8. As $l$ goes from $0$ to $c-2$, we obtain 3 values of numbers $l$ that meet this criterion. Thus, the initial double sum transforms into $\\frac{3}{s^3}$.9. This is correctly expressed as $\\frac{\\varphi\\left(c+1\\right)}{(c+1)^3}$.10. Substituting $c = p$, we obtain $\\frac{\\varphi(p+1)}{(p+1)^3}$.11. This single sum isn't directly related to $p$, but they can be combined to satisfy the condition. From step 1 gives $p = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{j^2} + \\frac{1}{(j+1)^2}\\right)$.12. Conclusion: $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\varphi(p+1)}{(p+1)^3} + \\frac{\\varphi(mp+1)}{(mp+1)^3}\\right)$.",

If a number $n$ can be expressed as $p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times ... \\times p_k^{a_k}$, then the number of divisors is given by $(a_1 + 1) \\times (a_2 + 1) \\times ... \\times (a_k + 1)$.Applying this formula to our prime factorization:- For the factor $2^2$, the number of divisors will be $(2 + 1) = 3$.\n- For the factor $7^2$, the number of divisors will be $(2 + 1) = 3$.Therefore, the total number of divisors is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.## Step 3: Verification\nTo verify these steps, we can list out the divisors of 196 and count them:1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.Counting these, indeed we find there are 9 divisors.## Step 4: Conclusion\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9.The equation concludes as requested, but I can refine it by directly stating the number of divisors without unnecessary steps:Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$.",
