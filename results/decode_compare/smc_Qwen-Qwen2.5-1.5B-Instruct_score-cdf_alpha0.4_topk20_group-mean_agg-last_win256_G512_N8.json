          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:    \\[\n    = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}.\n    \\]3. We make the substitution $m = j + k$, which yields $j = m - k$. For each value of $m$, $k$ increases from $1$ to $\\infty$. The summation becomes now $\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3 \\frac{m}{m-k}}$.4. Recognizing that $k = m - n$, where $n = 1$; this results in rearranging the terms and simplifying the expression.5. If we now represent the sum as a single sum, we have $\\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(m-n)^3}$.6. The last step now adds the first term, $m = 1$, which gives $1 \\times \\frac{1}{1^3} = \\frac{1}{1}$. 7. For $m \\neq 1$, the expression simplifies to $\\frac{1}{(m-1)^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\frac{m}{m-k}}$ becomes $\\frac{1}{(m-1)^3 \\frac{m}{m-k}}$.8. To simplify, we decompose this fraction into two parts:     \\[\n    \\frac{1}{(m-1) m} = \\frac{1}{m-1} - \\frac{1}{m}.\n    \\]9. Therefore, we arrive at the expression equivalent to the original sum:     \\[\n    \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = p + \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{(m-1)^3 \\frac{m}{m-k}} - \\left(\\frac{1}{(m-1)^3} \\frac{1}{\\frac{m}{m-k}}\\right)\\right).\n    \\]10. Observe each term is presented as a fraction diverging. Reducing the fraction to its simplest form yields:    \\[\n    = p + \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(m-1)^3 \\frac{m}{m-k}}.\n    \\]11. To arrive at the final result, we recognize that upon simplification, this yields:    \\[\n    = p + \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{(m-1)^3\\frac{m}{m-k}}\\right).\n    \\]12. This is equivalent to:    \\[\n    = p + \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(m-k)^3}.\n    \\]13. Consequently, the final sum can be written in terms of $p$ and $q$ by expressing the inner sum involving $q$:    \\[\n    \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(m-k)^3} = q.\n    \\]14. By substituting these expressions into the original sum, we get:    \\[\n    \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p + \\sum_{m = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} q.\n    \\]15. Therefore, the final answer is:    \\[\n    \\boxed{p + q\\sum_{m = 2}^\\in",
