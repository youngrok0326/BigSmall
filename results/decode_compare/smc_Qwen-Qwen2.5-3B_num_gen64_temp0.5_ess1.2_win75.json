          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. <think>\nFirst, let's analyze the given problem. We are asked to find a way to write the sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\).\n\nTo solve this, we can start by considering the double sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\). We can rewrite this sum by changing the order of summation. Let's define a new variable \\(m = j + k\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) can take values such that \\(j + k = m\\). This means \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(m-1\\), and \\(k\\) will be \\(m - j\\).\n\nSo, the double sum can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we can separate the inner sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{m^3} = \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} 1.\n\\]\n\nThe inner sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} 1\\) simply counts the number of terms in the range from 1 to \\(m-1\\), which is \\(m-1\\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} (m-1).\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this further:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{m-1}{m^3} = \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{m^2} - \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right).\n\\]\n\nNow, we can split this into two separate sums:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{m^2} - \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right) = \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} - \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nThe first sum is \\(p - 1\\) (since \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = p\\) and we exclude the \\(k=1\\) term):\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2} = p - 1.\n\\]\n\nThe second sum is \\(q - 1\\) (since \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} = q\\) and we exclude the \\(k=1\\) term):\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} = q - 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the original double sum can be written as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\\]\n\n2. <answer>\n\\[\n\\boxed{p - q}\n\\]",

We can see from the graph that the distance traveled by each student is the same, but the time taken is different. We can use the formula: \nAverage speed = (total distance traveled) / (total time taken)\nFor Evelyn, the total distance traveled is 6 units and the total time taken is 1.25 units. So, her average speed is 6 / 1.25 = 4.8 units per unit of time.\nFor Briana, the total distance traveled is 6 units and the total time taken is 2.5 units. So, her average speed is 6 / 2.5 = 2.4 units per unit of time.\nFor Carla, the total distance traveled is 6 units and the total time taken is 4.25 units. So, her average speed is 6 / 4.25 = 1.4 units per unit of time.\nFor Debra, the total distance traveled is 6 units and the total time taken is 5.6 units. So, her average speed is 6 / 5.6 = 1.07 units per unit of time.\nFor Angela, the total distance traveled is 6 units and the total time taken is 6.8 units.
