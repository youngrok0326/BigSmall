          "completion": " <think>\nFirst, let's review the information given in the problem. There are five different students, Evelyn, Briana, Carla, Debra, and Angela, who participated in a cross-country team's training run. The results of their runs are graphed below. We are to determine which student has the greatest average speed.\n\nTo find the average speed, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the total distance covered by each student is not provided. However, we can observe the time taken by each student to cover the distance. Let's denote the total time taken by each student as T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively, and the total distance covered by each student as D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, respectively.\n\nTo find the average speed of each student, we can use the following equations:\n\nEvelyn's average speed (E) = D1 / T1\nBriana's average speed (B) = D2 / T2\nCarla's average speed (C) = D3 / T3\nDebra's average speed (D) = D4 / T4\nAngela's average speed (A) = D5 / T5\n\nSince we don't have the values of D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, we can't directly calculate the average speeds. However, we can compare the time taken by each student. Let's assume that T1 \u2264 T2 \u2264 T3 \u2264 T4 \u2264 T5. If this assumption is true, then Evelyn would have the greatest average speed, since she took the least amount of time to complete the distance. Let's see if this assumption is correct.\n\nIf T1 \u2264 T2 \u2264 T3 \u2264 T4 \u2264 T5, then Evelyn's average speed would be greater than Briana's average speed, Carla's average speed, Debra's average speed, and Angela's average speed. Therefore, the student who has the greatest average speed is Evelyn.\n</think>\n<answer>\nEvelyn\n</answer>",
