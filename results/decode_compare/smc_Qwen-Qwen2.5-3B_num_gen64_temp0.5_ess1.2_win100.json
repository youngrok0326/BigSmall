Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert the point $(0,3)$ from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of $r$ and $\\theta$.\n\nRecall that in polar coordinates, a point is represented as $(r,\\theta)$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point, and $\\theta$ is the angle formed with the positive x-axis.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of $r$. In rectangular coordinates, the distance from the origin to the point $(x,y)$ is given by the formula $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. In this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, so we have:\n\n$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nNext, let's find the value of $\\theta$. In polar coordinates, the angle $\\theta$ can be found using the formula $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$. In this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, so we have:\n\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$\n\nHowever, the arctangent function is undefined when the denominator is zero. This means that the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis, which corresponds to an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (or 90 degrees) from the positive x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n</think>\n2. <answer>\n(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n</answer>",
