          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + j)^3}.\n\\]3. Swap the order of the sums $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ with $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\n\\]4. Now that we have swapped the order of sums, the double sum can be simplified. To do this, we can now rearrange the terms from $j = 1$ to $j = \\infty$ and perform a counterclockwise rotation, putting the terms respectively into Jensen's (based on the pattern [asymmetric/order-independent transformation]).5. From (1) to $(4)$:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\n\\]6. We can manipulate the double sum from (5) as follows:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + 1)^3}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k + j}.\n\\]7. Now, consider the inner summation $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k + j}$:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k + j} = \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k + 1} + \\frac{1}{k + 2} + \\cdots.\n\\]8. We perform the outer summation:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k + j} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k + j}\\right).\n\\]9. We then consider the expression from (8), perform the inner summation:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k + j}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\frac{\\pi^k}{e^{\\pi}}\\right).\n\\]10. Therefore, we have:\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k + j}\\right) = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\frac{\\pi^k}{e^{\\pi}}\\right).\n\\]11. Finally, we consider the definition of $q$:\\[\nq = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}.\n\\]12. Substitute back into (9):\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\",
