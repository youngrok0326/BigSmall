We use the Pythagorean theorem to find $r$. Since the x-coordinate is $0$, the distance is simply:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding $\\theta$:**\n   The angle $\\theta$ is found by considering the angle that the line segment from the origin to the point makes with the positive x-axis. Since the x-coordinate is $0$, the angle is:\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right).\n   \\]\n   However, since the x-coordinate is $0$, the line segment is on the positive y-axis, so $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are:\n\\[\n(r,\\theta) = (3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}).\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\n\\]",

We can separate the inner sum into $k^2$ for this specific case, since for each fixed $k$, the sum over $j$ can be thought of as integrating $k$ over $j$:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k+1)^2} = \\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we can express this as a combination of $p$ and $q$:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} - \\frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1\n\\]\n\nSo we substitute back to get:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = p - 1 = p - q.\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks for $q$, we see that $q$ represents the same part in $p$ as in $q$, but not in an isolated form yet.
