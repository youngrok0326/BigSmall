          "answer": "9",
          "completion": "In a competitive programming problem, we need to find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196. To find the divisors of 196, we consider its prime factorization: 196 = 2^2 * 7^2. To find the number of divisors, we use the formula for finding divisors of a number based on its prime factorization: if n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... ... p_n^a_n, then the total number of divisors is (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)... (ana_n + 1). For 196, we have:a1 = 2, a2 = 2, a3 = 2, ... ... a6 = 2, a7 = 2, a8 = 2, a9 = 2, a10 = 2, and a12 = 2.So, using the formula, we get: (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 * 3 = 9 divisors of 196.Now, we have to write this as an expression:Therefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.
