Since the projection onto the positive x-axis is undefined for angles greater than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ due to the $y$-axis, we conclude that $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (since $y > x$), and thus:$$ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $$### Step 2: Calculate $\\theta$\nSince both $x$ and $y$ are positive, the point $(0, 3)$ lies on the positive $y$-axis when viewed positively (i.e., counting counterclockwise from the $x$-axis).Thus, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.Therefore, the polar coordinates are $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, where $r = 3$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (the value satisfies the restriction $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi$).Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",

          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration second. We note that the outer circle is over the infinite sum (i.e., $j$ runs from $1$ to $\\infty$) but we are adding only up to $c-1$. Using the formula $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{jc} + \\frac{1}{c-j} = \\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j} + \\frac{1}{c-j}$, we combine the two series to get $\\frac{2}{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j}$.4. We can rewrite the second series in term of $c$ using the formula $\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{j} = H_{n-1}$ where $H_n$ is the nth harmonic number:   $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j} = \\frac{1}{c}(H_c - \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j})$   Therefore, the double sum simplifies to:   $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{c}H_{c-1} + \\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j}$   $= \\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}H_{c-1} + \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{jc}$5. Now, notice that using gamma: $\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{j} = \\gamma + \\sum_{j=2}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{j}$, where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.6. Therefore, we get the same result as before:   $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{jc} + \\frac{1}{c-j}$   Putting it together, the double sum simplifies to:   $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{c}(\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{x}) + \\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{jc}$   Note that we have to sum the double sum over the values of $c$.7. Finally, we have the term $q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$. Using this information about the double sum, it is clear that the final answer is $\\frac{p}{q}$.",
