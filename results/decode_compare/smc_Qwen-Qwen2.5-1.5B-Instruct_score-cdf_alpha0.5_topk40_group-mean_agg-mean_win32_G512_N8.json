Perform the inner circle ($k$-sum) change of variables: $k = j + t$, then $k = t + 1$. This gives you:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j + t)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3}$$3. Rearrange the terms: $$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^t}.$$ 4. For $t = 1$, we require the value of $\\frac{1}{(j + 1)^t}$ at $t = 1$. Thus, we get:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^t} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\left(\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^{t+1}}\\right).$$5. Perform the inner circle ($t$-sum) change of variables: $t = j + s$, then $t = s + 1$. This gives you:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\left(\\sum_{s = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^{s+1}}\\right).$$6. Rearrange the terms:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\left(\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^{t+1}}\\right) = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^{t+1}}\\frac{1}{j^3}.$$7.

Since $(j + 1)^{t+1} = j^t \\cdot j^2 \\cdot j\\cdot \\frac{1}{j^t}$, then we have:$$ = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^t\\cdot j^2 \\cdot j \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{j^t}\\right)}\\frac{1}{j^3}= \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}\\frac{1}{j^2}=\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^3}.$$9. Keeping $p$ and $q$ as before, evaluate the expression:$$= \\frac{q}{p}.$$10. Therefore, we have:$$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^{t+1}}\\frac{1}{j^3} = \\frac{q}{p}.$$Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{q}{p",
