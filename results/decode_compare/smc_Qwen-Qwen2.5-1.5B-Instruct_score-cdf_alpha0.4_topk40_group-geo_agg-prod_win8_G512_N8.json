          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:   - First, we express the sum as $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$.\n   \n3. Next, we rewrite the sum of fractions $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$ in a way that allows us to see a pattern:   - This fraction can be written as $\\frac{1}{j} \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{k}{j}}$.4. By defining $q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$, we can rewrite the expression as $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j} \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{k}{j}}$.5. By rearranging the sum, we can express it as $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{k}{j}}$, which can be further manipulated to $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j(j+k)}$.6. By changing the order of summation, we can write it as $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j (j+k)} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$.7. We now exchange the order of the sums, which gives us $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k (j+k)} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$.8. Rewriting the inner sum as $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$, we get $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$.9. By expanding the double sum, we have $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$.10. By changing the order of summation again, we can write this as $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k}$.11. Grouping the terms by $k$, we get $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j +k} + \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j+k} \\right)$.12. Simplifying the inner sums, we find $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k + j} + \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k + j}\\right)$.13. Combining the sums, we have $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$, which can be expressed as $\\frac{p^2}{2}$.14. Solving for $p$ from Step 1, we get $p = \\frac{2}{5}$.15.
