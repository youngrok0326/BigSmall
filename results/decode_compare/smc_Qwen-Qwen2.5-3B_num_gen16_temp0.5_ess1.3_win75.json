Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius (r) and the angle (\u03b8) of the point. The radius (r) is the distance from the origin to the point, and the angle (\u03b8) is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.\n2. <think>\nThe radius (r) can be found using the formula:\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\nwhere x and y are the rectangular coordinates of the point.\n3. <think>\nIn this problem, the rectangular coordinates are (0,3). So, we can substitute x = 0 and y = 3 into the formula to find the radius:\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n4. <think>\nNow, we need to find the angle (\u03b8). We can use the formula:\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\nwhere x",
