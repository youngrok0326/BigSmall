          "completion": "To convert the rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we use the following formulas:1. $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ (for the distance from the origin to the point)\n2. $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$ (for the angle from the positive x-axis to the point, projected onto the positive x-axis by the right-hand rule)where $\\arctan(\\frac{y}{x})$ gives the exact angle in radians for a point (x, y) in the first quadrant, but $\\theta$ can be positive in any quadrant.Now, substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 3$ into these formulas, we get:1. $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$ (since $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + y^2$, this simplifies directly to $y^2$)2. $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$In the first quadrant, where the tangent is effectively undefined, but we know the $y$ must be the absolute value of 3 units (positive) up the y-axis.Therefore, we must have the coordinates at this angle from the x-axis to be positive, since we can't have negative distance (which is still valid in radians).Now, plugging in the values for $x = 0$ and $y = 3$ for $\\arctan$, we have $\\theta = \\arctan(\\frac{3}{0})$, which gives $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees, or 9/18 of the total circle angle).Therefore, using the formulas:- $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$\n- $\\theta = \\arctan(\\frac{3}{0}) = \\pi/2$It follows that:Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(3,\\pi/2)}$.",

Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[ = \\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]\n\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\\]3. Next, we swap the variables $j$ and $k$ in the inner sum:\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = k}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + j)^3}.\\]4. Now, we can perform a change of index by letting $k = m - n$ for some $n, m \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\\[ = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{m = n}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(n + m)^3}.\\]5. We can now switch the order of summation:\\[ = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{m = n}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(n + m)^3}.\\]6. We have four primary regimes of summations:- If $k \\leq m$, then we only consider the terms where $n + m = m - k \\geq n$.\n- If $k > m$, then we only consider the terms where $n \\geq k$.7. Therefore, we have the following regimes for the final double sum:- If $k \\leq m$, then we consider $n \\in [1, m - k]$.\n- If $k > m$, then we consider $n \\in [1, k]$.8. So, the final double sum can be written as:\\[ = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{m = n}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(n + m)^3}.\\]At this point, we can use Faulhaber's formula to express the sum in terms of $p$ and $q$ as follows:Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{p - q}$.",
