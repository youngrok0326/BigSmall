          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. In the next outer circle, let us integrate out $j$, so we just have the sum $\\sum_{1\\leq k \\leq c}\\frac{1}{k^3}$.4. Perform this sum now, using the formula for the sum of a series of reciprocals: \n$\\sum_{1\\leq k \\leq c}\\frac{1}{k^3} = \\sum_{m=1}^c\\frac{1}{m^3}$.5. Substitute $m = c-j$ into the sum:\n$\\sum_{1\\leq k \\leq c}\\frac{1}{k^3} = \\sum_{m=1}^c\\frac{1}{(c-m)^3} = \\sum_{n=1}^c\\frac{1}{n^3}$.6. Now, we need to relate the inner sum to $p$. As mentioned in step 1, $p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$. We can use this to find the pattern between the sums.\nThe pattern suggests that the sum of reciprocals of cubes for numbers up to $c$ is the same as the sum of reciprocals of squares, due to the symmetry in the terms of the series.7. Regarding the inner sum, we have:\n$p = \\sum_{j=1}^c \\frac{j}{j^2} = \\sum_{j=1}^c \\frac{1}{j} - \\sum_{j=1}^c \\frac{1}{j^2}$.8. Therefore, our final answer is:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^c \\frac{1}{i^3} = \\sum_{i=1}^c \\frac{i}{i^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^c \\frac{1}{i} - \\sum_{i=1}^c \\frac{1}{i^2}$.9. The finite sum $q$ is defined as $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$. Thus, we can conclude:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p - q\n\\]Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{p - q}$.",
