          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can utilize the formula for the sum of a series of reciprocals of the reciprocals of the terms of a sequence. Thus, we have $p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$. 3. Let's call the reciprocal of $p$ as $q$ for easier identification. Therefore, we have $\\frac{1}{p} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$. 4. Now let's consider the form of the term $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. When we expand this term, we get $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{(j+k)(j+k)(j+k)}$.5. We can simplify this further by observing that $\\frac{1}{(j+k)} = \\frac{1}{j+k}$. Thus, we have $\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{(j+k)}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(j+k)} = \\frac{1}{j}\\cdot\\frac{1}{k}$.6. Now let's consider the product $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. We can rewrite the summation by changing the variable $k$ to $j$ and vice versa. 7. We get $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 8. Using the same logic as the reciprocal of $p$, we can write $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3} = \\frac{1}{q}$.9. We can apply the same logic to $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}$ as explained above.10. Now let's change $j$ to $k$ and $k$ to $j$. We have $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}$.11. We can simplify this using the same logic, which gives us $\\frac{1}{q}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^2}$.12. We can view the summation $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^2}$ as $q$.13. Now let's consider the original double summation $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.14. We can rewrite the summation by changing the order of summation. 15. We get $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.16. We can change the order of summation by swapping the order of summation. 17. We get $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(k+1)^3}$. 18. Let's consider the double summation in step 17.19. We can rewrite the summation by changing the variable $k$ to $l$ and vice versa. 20. We get $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+i)^3}\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(i+1)^3}$.21. Now we can swap the order of summation again.22. We get $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(i+1)^3}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(j+i)^3}$.23. We can change the variable $i$ to $j$ and vice versa.24",
