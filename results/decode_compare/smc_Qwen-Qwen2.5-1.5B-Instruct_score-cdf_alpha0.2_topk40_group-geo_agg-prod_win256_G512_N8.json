We can separate the sums involving \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) as follows:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]We can combine the factors \\(\\frac{1}{j^3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) into a single fraction:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]Now, let's consider the second sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\). We can rewrite the inner sum by changing the index \\(j\\) to \\(j-k\\) (for \\(k \\geq 1\\)):\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+(j-k))^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2j-j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2j-j+k)^3}. \\]For \\(k = 1\\), the mixed term \\(\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}\\) is simpler to handle.

The total distance is 4.5 units and the time is 7 units of time. Therefore, Evelyn's average speed is \\(4.5 / 7 = 0.642857\\) units of distance per unit of time.- **Briana**: Briana's graph shows a line from (2.5, 2.2) to (8, 0). The total distance is 2.2 units and the time is 5.5 units of time. Therefore, Briana's average speed is \\(2.2 / 5.5 = 0.39\\) units of distance per unit of time.- **Carla**: Carla's graph shows a line from (4.25, 5.2) to (8, 0). The total distance is 5.2 units and the time is 3.75 units of time. Therefore, Carla's average speed is \\(5.2 / 3.75 = 1.4\\) units of distance per unit of time.- **Debra**: Debra's graph shows a line from (5.6, 2.8) to (8, 0).
