          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}$.3. Simplify the double sum from step 2: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j(c-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{jc}-\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}\\right)$.4. Change the indices repeatedly and you will see that the double sum approaches the entire limit of the double sum. In this case, they are $c$ and $q$.5. Thus, the double sum is now expressed as $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{jc}\\frac{1}{q}$.6. Substitute for $c = \\sum_{k=1}^{c}\\frac{1}{k^2}$ and obtain $\\approx\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{jc}-\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}\\right)$.7. We can rewrite it as $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\left(\\frac{1}{j}-\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}\\right)\\right)$.8. We can simplify this further to $\\approx\\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{j}-\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}\\right)$.9. After these manipulations, we can see that the double sum can be expressed as $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{j}-\\frac{1}{j(c-j)}\\right)$.10. With these components, we have \n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left( p + \\frac{1}{c(c-j)} - q\\right).\\]11. The value of $p$ is equal to $S_2$. To find the value of $q$, we just saw that the value in the double sum is equal to $S_3$.12. The sum of the series becomes $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\left( 1 + \\frac{p}{c(c-j)} - q\\right)$.13. Therefore, we can conclude that the double sum is $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\approx \\frac{1}{c}(p + 1) + \\frac{p}{c(c-1)} - q$.14. Finally, that is $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\approx \\frac{p + 1}{c} - \\frac{p(c-1)}{c^2}$.15. We can now conclude that the double sum is $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\approx \\frac{p + 1}{c} - \\frac{p(c-1)}{c^2}$.16. Therefore, the answer is $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c} \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} \\approx \\frac{p + 1}{c} - \\frac{p(c-1)}{c^2} $.",
