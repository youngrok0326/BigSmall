Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta$.\nThe radius $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\nIn this case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, so\n$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point. In this case, the point is on the y-axis, so the angle is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n</think>\n<answer>\n(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n</answer>",
