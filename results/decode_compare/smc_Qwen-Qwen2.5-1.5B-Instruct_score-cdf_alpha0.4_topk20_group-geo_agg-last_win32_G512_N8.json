          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, we have $j + (c-k) = c$. Now, let's define $i = c - k$. Then when $i = 0$, we have $j = c$. Therefore, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{i = 0}^{c-1} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(i + j)^3}$.  3. Now, we perform the inner (circle, $j$) integration. Again, when $i + j = p$, we have $i + (p-j) = p$. Hence, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(i + j)^3}$. 4. At this point, we realize that if we add another variable we will be able to combine both sums. 5. Define $b = q$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(i + j)^3} = \\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3}$.6. Now, it remains to find a more convenient way to combine these expressions to be written similarities with a simpler expression. In particular, how about we consider rearranging the order of summation and adding more terms in the inner circle? 7. Thus, we rewrite $\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3}$ as $\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3}$ as $(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3})\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3}$. 8. Substitute $q$ for $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3}$, we get $\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3} = q\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3}$. 9. Rearranging the order of summation, we get $\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3} = q\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3}$. 10. Simplifying, we get $\\sum_{i = 0}^{p-1}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i^3 + j^3} = q\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{q^3 + j^3}$ by substituting $q$ into the expression. 11. From here, we can finally evaluate the summations, arriving at the final answer. Conclusion: $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = q\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{q^3 + j^3}$. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}",
