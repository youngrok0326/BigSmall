          "completion": "## Step 1: Read the problem carefully\nTo find the student with the greatest average speed, we need to first calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. ## Step 2: Understand the formula for average speed\nThe average speed (in mph) can be calculated using the formula: average speed = total distance (in miles) / total time (in hours). This formula is derived from the basic concept of distance traveled per unit of time. ## Step 3: Calculate the total distance and total time\nFor instance, Evelyn runs 1.25 miles according to her route, Briana runs 2.5 miles, Carla runs 4.25 miles, Debra runs 5.6 miles, Angela runs 6.8 miles, and Angela also runs 1.4 miles back to her starting point. ## Step 4: Divide the running distances to find the average speed\nAfter computing the distances, we can then sum them and divide by the number of miles to find the average speed: Average speed = (1.25 + 2.5 + 4.25 + 5.6 + 6.8 + 1.4) miles/hour Say she divides these values as follows:Average speed = 1.25 + 2.5 = 3.75 miles/hour Average speed = 3.75 + 4.25 = 7.0 miles/hour Average speed = 7.0 + 5.6 = 12.6 miles/hour Average speed = 12.6 + 6.8 = 19.4 miles/hour So, Evelyn has the fastest average speed at 3.75 miles/hour.## Step 5: Explain the steps in a step-by-step manner\nFirst, we need to calculate the average speed using the formula given, which involves summing the distances and dividing by the total time.Then, since the averages are independently calculated, we would find that Angela's average speed is the greatest (1.4 miles per hour).## Step 6: Provide a clear and concise explanation\nThe greatest average speed is Angela's on her back-to-back trips.\u661f\u7ea7system\nSolve the following math problem efficiently and clearly:- For simple problems (2 steps or fewer):\nProvide a concise solution with minimal explanation.- For complex problems (3 steps or more):\nUse",
