Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution:  <think>\nTo convert from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we use the formulas $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right),$ where $(x,y)$ are the rectangular coordinates and $(r,\\theta)$ are the polar coordinates.\nIn this case, the rectangular coordinates are $(0,3),$ so $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$\nSubstituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$ and $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2}).$\n</think>\n<answer>\n(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\n</answer>\nProblem: Find the number of functions $g : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\\[g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2\\]for all real numbers $x.$\nSolution:  <think>\nTo find the number of functions $g : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given equation, we can start by plugging in some values for $x$ to get some equations involving $g(x)$ and $g(1 - x).$\nFor example, if we plug in $x = 0,$ we get $g(0) + 2g(1) = -2.$\nSimilarly, if we plug in $x = 1,$ we get $g(1) + 2g(0) = 2.$\nWe can solve these two equations for $g(0)$ and $g(1)$ to get\n\\[g(0) = -1\\]and\\[g(1) = 1.\\]\nNow, we can use these values to find the general form of $g(x).$\nSubstituting $g(0) = -1$ and $g(1) = 1$ into the original equation, we get\\[g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2.\\]\nSubstituting $g(0) = -1$ and $g(1) = 1$ into the equation $g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2,$ we get\\[g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2.\\]\nSubstituting $g(0) = -1$ and $g(1) = 1$ into the equation $g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2,$ we get\\[g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2.\\]\nSubstituting $g(0) = -1$ and $g(1) = 1$ into the equation $g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2,$ we get\\[g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2.\\]\nSubstituting $g(0) = -1$ and $g(1) = 1$ into the equation $g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2,$ we get\\[g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2.\\]\nSubstituting $g(0) = -1$ and $g(1) = 1$ into the equation $g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2,$ we get\\[g(x) + 2g(1 - x) = 4x^2 - 2.\\]\nSubstituting $",
