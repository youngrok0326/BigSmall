From the graph, we can see that Evelyn traveled a distance of 4.5 miles, Briana traveled a distance of 2.2 miles, Carla traveled a distance of 5.2 miles, and Angela traveled a distance of 2.8 miles. Next, we need to find the time it took each student to travel the distance. From the graph, we can see that Evelyn took 1.25 hours, Briana took 2.5 hours, Carla took 4.25 hours, and Angela took 5.6 hours. Now, we can calculate the average speed for each student by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Evelyn's average speed is 4.5/1.25 = 3.6 miles per hour, Briana's average speed is 2.2/2.5 = 0.88 miles per hour, Carla's average speed is 5.2/4.25 = 1.23 miles per hour, and Angela's average speed is 2.8/5.6 = 0.5 miles per hour.
