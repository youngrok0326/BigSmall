Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius (r) and the angle (\u03b8) of the point. The radius (r) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the radius (r) is the hypotenuse, and the x and y coordinates are the other two sides. The formula for the radius is:\n\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nThe angle (\u03b8) can be found using the arctangent function, which gives the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point. The formula for the angle is:\n\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\nHowever, we need to",
