Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think> To convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius (r) and angle (\u03b8) of the point in the polar coordinate system. The radius (r) represents the distance of the point from the origin, and the angle (\u03b8) represents the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point. We can find r using the Pythagorean theorem: r = \u221a(x^2 + y^2), where x and y are the rectangular coordinates. In this case, the point is (",

The right-hand side ends with A, while the left-hand side ends with 93. Since the only digit that, when multiplied by 3, ends in 93, it must be B = 8. Therefore, A = 8 and B = 8.\n\nNow we substitute B = 8 into the equation:\n\n1837993 * 88 = 11398893\n\nThis gives us:\n\n16343944 = 11398893\n\nSo the value of positiveAB is 88.\n\n<br>\nProblem: find the largest whole number n for which the equation 10*(1/11)^(n+1) + 11*(1/10)^(n+1) = 98/90000 holds true.\nSolution: 10*(1/11)^(x+1) + 11*(1/10)^(x+1) = 98/90000\nand 10*(1/11)^(x+1) + 11*(1/10)^(x+1) = + 10*(1/11)^(x+1) + 11*(1/10)^(x+1)\nand 98/90000 = 98/90000\nand 10*(1/11)^(x+1) + 11*(1/10)^(x+1) = 98/90000\nand 98/90000 = 98/90000\nand 10*(1/11)^(x+1) + 11*(1/10)^(x+1) = 98/90000\nand 98/90000 = 98/90000\nand 10*(1/11)^(x+1) + 11*(1/10)^(x+1) = 9",
