For $\\theta$:  \n$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) $$Using the given point $(0, 3)$, we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3$. Let's calculate $r$ first:$$ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $$Now we need to calculate $\\theta$. Since $x = 0$ means we're at the y-axis, $\\theta$ will be an angle measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. At the y-axis, for $x = 0$, the angle is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees), but since we have to start from the x-axis, we subtract this 90 degrees from $2\\pi$, as we have already calculated the first quadrant angle.So,$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right) = \\arctan(\\infty) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$Since the point is above the x-axis, $\\theta$ should be adjusted for the fact that we're considering the angle starting from the positive y-axis. Therefore, the angle is actually less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Given that the point is in the second quadrant (as the y-coordinate is positive and the x-coordinate is zero), the angle $\\theta$ should be between $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\pi$.Therefore:$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$Since $r = 3$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$, the final answer is:$$ \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})} $$",
