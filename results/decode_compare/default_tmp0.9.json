Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: ",

          "completion": "1. **Understand what the problem is asking.**\n    The problem is asking us to convert the point $(0,3)$ into polar coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, this point would be written as $(x,y) = (0,3),$ meaning it lies at the origin on the x-axis. The radial distance ($r$) and the angle ($\\theta$) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric functions, respectively.\n    Here, $x = 0$ and $y = 3,$ so $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3.$ However, no specific $\\theta$ is mentioned. Since Cartesian coordinates have an angle ($\\theta$) from the origin in both the $x$ and $y$ axes, we need more information about where the terminal arm points on the coordinate axes to determine $\\theta.$\n\n    **Justification:**\n    There are two way to determine $\\theta$:\n        1. Using the right triangle defined by the origin, the line segments $\\rho$ (r) and $\\theta.$ The hypotenuse would be equal to $r.$\n           [This would be the endpoint of the side of the triangle from the origin to (0,3), which is in reality $r = 3$.]\n        2. Using the right triangle defined by the center of the circle (0,0) and the point $(0,3)$ which is on the line $(x,0)$. The side of the triangle is the distance of (0,3) from (0,0), that is, $\\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}.$ The hypotenuse would be the radius of the circle, which is also $r=3.$\n           [This would be given as the distance of the line from the origin, $(0,0),$ to $(0,3).$\n\n    **In summary:** The radial distance of the point with the coordinates (0,3) is $\\text{r}=3$. To find $\\theta,$ we wouldn't use the $\\rho/\\theta$ definition but rather the $\\theta/ \\rho$ definition. Thus, we should leave the $\\theta$ as $\\theta$.

Express your answer as a common fraction.\nSolution: ",

          "completion": "1.\nThink:\nThe rational function $f(x) =\\frac{3x-2}{x-2}$ can be represented in the form of $f(x) = ax+b$. How do we find the values of $a$ and $b$?\nTo find $a$ we can set $x=0$ and solve the equation $f(0) = 0$. Thus $f(0) = 0 \\ \\implies \\stackrel{\\bullet} {a} + b = 0 \\ \\ \\ \\implies \\stackrel{ \\bullet }{a} = 0$ and $b = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = x$.\nSimilarly, we can find the key to find the value of $f(x)$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To find the value of $f(x)$ for any $x$, we need to find the domain of the function (all real numbers for $x$) and then plug $x$ into the function to find $f(x)$. To find the domain of the rational function $f(x) = \\frac{3x-2}{x-2}$, we can set $x \\neq 2$. Thus, the domain for the rational function is: 1.\nThen, since $f(x) = x$ is the only function we are trying to find, we can set $x = 2$. Thus $f(2) = 2$ and the function opens up, which means $f(2+2) = f(4) = 4$. The same reasoning applies for any other value of $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Now, we can insert the values back into the equation $f(x) = x$. Thus\n$f(-2) = -2$\n$f(-1) = -1$\n$f(0) = 0$\nTherefore, $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = -2 + (-1) + 0 = -3$\nYou will find the value of the prompt.",
