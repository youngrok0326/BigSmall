          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$) integration first. Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Now, let's expand the sum $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$ as a single sum. This can be written as $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{c(1+j/c)}{(c-j)^3}$.4. After partial expand the summation into a single summation $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{j^3}-\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$. This formula is incorrect as it lacks the correct terms.5. We can also consider the double sum in another way: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}1 - \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}-\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}1$.6. Now, we can separate the double sum into single summation: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3} - \\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}$.7. Using the same idea from Step 7, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\Big(\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}-\\frac{1}{(k+c)^3}\\Big)$.8. This double summation is equivalent to $\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c)jk}$. 9. Therefore, the value of $\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}-\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}$ is $0$.10. On the other hand, as explained in Step 1, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\frac{c+1}{j^3}-\\sum_{j=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$.11. Now, we need to find the correct expression for $q$ which is $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$.12. After partial expansion of this expression, we get $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$.13. As explained in Step 1, we have $q = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$.14. Therefore, we have $q = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$.15. As explained in Step 1 and Step 14, we have $p = \\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}$.16. Therefore, we have $p = \\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\frac{1}{(j+c)^3}$.17. Now, using the definitions of $",
