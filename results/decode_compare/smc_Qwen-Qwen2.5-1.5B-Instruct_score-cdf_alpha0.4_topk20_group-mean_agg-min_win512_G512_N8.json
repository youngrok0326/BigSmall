Calculate $r$. Since the x-coordinate is $0$ and the y-coordinate is $3$, the distance from the origin to the point is $0$. However, this is incorrect; the point itself is the origin, not a typical Cartesian coordinate. The correct interpretation of the question is that we're dealing with the Cartesian coordinates instead of a polar one. This could mean the question is misstated or requires a different interpretation. Assuming the point is indeed $(0, 3)$ being along the positive y-axis, we should correct this and say the point is $(0, 3)$ in polar coordinates, where $r = 3$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, since the point is exactly above the origin.2. Calculate $\\theta$. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians or $90^\\circ$.Therefore, corrected, the answer for $(0, 3)$ in polar coordinates would be $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",
