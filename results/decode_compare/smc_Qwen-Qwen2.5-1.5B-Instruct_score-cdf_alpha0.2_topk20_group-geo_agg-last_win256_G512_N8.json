Let's sum over \\(j\\) first, then \\(k\\):\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]Now consider the inner sum:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}. \\]\nNotice that the terms of this sum can be approximated by the series \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).
