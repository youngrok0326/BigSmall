The steps to do this are as follows:### Step 2: Determine the radius (r)\nThe radius can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\nGiven $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, we have:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\]### Step 3: Determine the angle (\u03b8)\nThe angle is typically given in the first quadrant and its relationship with the radius can be found using trigonometry:\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\]\nSince $x = 0$ and $y = 3$:\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan(3) \\]The angle $\\theta$ should be in the range $[0, \\pi]$.

Regarding the quadratic function, it is a vertically translated parabola. Also, the quadratic polynomial is a 3rd degree polynomial. Thus, we start with the quadratic term and proceed with the smaller degrees. Let's begin:$f(x) = ax^2 + bx - 2a$with $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0)$ being the required expression at this stage.Step 1: Expand the basic quadratic equation by completing the square to find the vertex's coordinates. Then, convert the vertex coordinates into a general iterated polynomial formula to express $(f-1)(x+2)$, the standard form of a thermometer, after knowing the temperature at $(x-2)/2$ equals 0.To initiate this process, we need to determine the coefficient of $(x-2)^2$ in the quadratic equation. As it's a multiple of $(x-2)^2$, we can directly use the original formula, balancing the coefficient of $(x-2)$. Once we define the constant a, we can compute $f(1)$, $(f-1)(2)$, and $(f-1)(-2)$, ultimately forming $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0)$.Using Python, we can compute these steps programmatically and find out that $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = \\frac{3 + 27 - 4}{(-2) - (-1) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15$.Therefore, the value of $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0)$ is:\n$$\n\\boxed{15}\n$$",

Shirley runs the optimal run before going out of bounds, while Debra runs last.Step 2: Define the variables\nb = the actual duration of the minute and the hour in the answer\nThe optimal run of 200 meters is 20 units ahead of going out of bounds, which means the optimal run is 20 minutes before escaping bounds. Shirley runs the optimal run first, and Debra runs last. The optimal run lasts for the designated time, minus the minutes Shirley will run out of bounds.\nStep 3: Calculate the duration of the distances together with the optimal run distance\nTo calculate each students' distances together with the optimal run, we can use the relationship of the difference in the free and bound time, and the optimal run time.\nStep 4: We can allocate the free and bound time very similarly to how this application problem starts. The difference between perimeter length and squares in perimeter length A = perimeter length B - perimeter length A. The difference between optimal free and bound time for the win A = optimal free time b - optimal bound time b. The difference between optimal free and bound time for the run out of bounds A - optimal free and bound time for the win O = optimal time b - optimal free and bound time for the win O = free and bound time D - optimal bound time b. Now we get the period time difference between run and bound b. So the distance run out of bounds is the difference between optimal free time b and optimal bound time b.\nStep 5: Calculate Brinley's distance with the optimal free and bound time\nTo calculate the distance Brinley will run with optimal free and bound time, we use the optimal free and bound time b - optimal bound time b, minus the difference in free time b - optimal free time b.\nStep 6: Calculate Angela's Distance with Optimal Free and Bound Time\nTo calculate Angela's distance with optimal bound time b minus optimal bound time b minus the difference in optimal free time b minus optimal free time b, minus optimal free time b, we use the optimal bound time b A = optimal bound time b - optimal free time",
