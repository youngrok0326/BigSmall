Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$\nSolution: 1. <think>\nTo convert a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius (r) and the angle (\u03b8) of the point in the polar coordinate system. The radius (r) is the distance from the origin to the point, and the angle (\u03b8) is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point.\n2. <think>\nIn rectangular coordinates, the point (0, 3) is located on the positive y-axis. The radius (r) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (r) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (x and y). In this case, the x-coordinate is 0 and the y-coordinate is 3, so the radius (r) is:\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a9 = 3\n3. <think>\nTo find the angle (",
