          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$-sum) change of variables: $k = j + t$, then $k = t + 1$. This gives you:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}\n\\]3. simplify this with another change of variable: $j^2 = t + 1, t = j^2 - 1$. This gives you:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2+t)^3}\n\\]4. Substitute $1 = t - k$, now:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2 + (t-k))^3}\n\\]5. Since $t$ can take any positive real numbers, we should add 1 to smooth it:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2 + (t-1))^3}\n\\]6. Interchange the sums by changing order:\\[\n\\sum_{t=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2 + (t-1))^3}\n\\]7. Distribute $1/(j^2 + (t-1)^2)^3$:\\[\n\\sum_{t=1}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2)^3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{(j^2 + (t-1)^2)^3}\\right)\n\\]8. Now, interchanging sums again yields:\\[\n\\sum_{t=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(t-1)^3}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2)^3}\n\\]9.

But, here is the sum of dual (with $p$ and $1-p$):\\[\nc = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} \\text{ (see} \\text{ this)}\n\\]11.

Therefore, our answer is:$\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j^2 + (t-1))^3} = \\frac{p}{1-p}$Therefore, the final answer is: $\\frac{p}{1-p}$.",
