Using the first formula:$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$The second formula can only be used if $x \\neq 0$. Since $x = 0$, there's no need for the second formula.Thus, the polar coordinates are:$(r,\\theta) = (3,\\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right))$However, $\\arctan$ cannot handle division by zero in this case, so the natural solution method is to use the angle measured from the positive x-axis, which in this case is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ due to the fact that the y-coordinate is positive and the x-coordinate is zero.Therefore, the final answer is:$(r,\\theta) = (3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$Thus, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",

Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration second. Now, the outer circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.4. Perform the inner circle (K) integration when only the outer circle ($j$) remains. The inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-j)^3}$.5. Perform the outer circle (J) integration when only the inner circle (K) remains.

Thus, the final outer circle becomes the sum: $\\sum_{m=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{(c-1-m)^3}$.7. Perform the final circle (N) integration when only the final inner circle (K) remains. The inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{k=1}^{c}\\frac{k}{(c-k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^{c}\\frac{k}{[c-k]^3}$.8.
