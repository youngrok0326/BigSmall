          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + j)^3}.\n\\]3. By interchanging the order of summation, we have:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\n\\]4. Let's re-arrange the terms so that the sum is in a form related to $\\frac{1}{k^3}$:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k)^3\\left(\\frac{j}{k}+1\\right)^2}.\n\\]5. Simplify the expression:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{j}{k}+1\\right)^{-2}.\n\\]6. Now, let's look at the original double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ in a different configuration:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.\n\\]7. By interchanging the order of summation again, we get:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k + j)^3}.\n\\]8. Simplify the second sum:\\[\n\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in\\mathbb{N}}\\frac{1}{j + k} }{k^3} = \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum\\limits_{j}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{j + k} = \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\sum\\limits_{j}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1 + k/j} = \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\frac{1}{1 + k^{-1}} \\cdot \\sum\\limits_{j}^{\\infty}j^{-1}.\\]9. The remaining sum simplifies to:\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j + k} = \\frac{j}{j + k}\\cdot\\frac{1}{j+k} = \\frac{1}{j+k} - \\frac{1}{j+k+1},\n\\]where we assume this simplifies appropriately for further calculations.10.

For the prime factorization $2^2 \\times 7^2$, we have two 2's and two 7's, so the total number of divisors is given by $(2+1)(2+1)$. This is because each factor in the prime factorization can be multiplied by any of the available powers of that prime.## Step 4: Calculate total divisors\nWith 2 factors in total for 2 and 2 factors in total for 7, the multiplication gives us $(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.Therefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.The final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$.",
