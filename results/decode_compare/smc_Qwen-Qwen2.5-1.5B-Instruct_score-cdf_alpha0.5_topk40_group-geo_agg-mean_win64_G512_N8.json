Calculate $r$:$r = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$2. Calculate $\\theta$:$\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$Since the x-coordinate is zero and the y-coordinate is positive, we know that the angle lies in the first or fourth quadrant. We need to determine which one it is. In the first quadrant ($0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos(\\theta)$ is positive, so the angle is less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. However, if we move the point $(0, 3)$ one unit to the right, we enter the fourth quadrant, where the angle is greater than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ but less than $\\pi$ (since the coordinate $(0, 3)$ is a y-intercept).In the first quadrant, $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$; though, as we move to the right, the angle becomes $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\arctan(3)$.In the fourth quadrant, $\\theta$ is $\\frac{3 \\pi}{2}$.Therefore, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (in the first quadrant) or $\\theta = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2}$ (in the fourth quadrant).Since this is a strict solution, we go with both possible options:$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (first quadrant solution)Or$\\theta = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2}$ (fourth quadrant solution)Since we need $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi$, we use the wrapping angle.The correct value:$r = 3$And the wrapping angle is:$\\theta = \\arctan(3)$Therefore, the final answer is:$(r, \\theta) = \\left(3, \\arctan(3)\\right)$ or $(3, \\frac{3 \\pi}{2})$.However, since the wrapping angle is not explicitly given in the requested format, we can express the angle in the correct range for the second answer.The angle in the first quadrant:$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$Therefore, the final answer is:$\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$",
