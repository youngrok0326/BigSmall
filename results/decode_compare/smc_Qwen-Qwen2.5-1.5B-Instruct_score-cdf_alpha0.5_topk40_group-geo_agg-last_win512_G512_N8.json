          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. Perform the inner circle ($k$-sum) change of variables: $k = j + t$, then $k = t + 1$. This gives you:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}\n\\]3. Step 2.1. By linearity of summation, this involves two separate sums. Thus, we have:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+t)+k^3} = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+t)+k^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+t)+k^3}\\right)\n\\]4. Step 2.2. Now, consider the sums done in this manner. The inner circle ($k$-sum) change of variables to $k = j + u$, also gives a similar change: $u = t - 1$, hence:\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{u=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+t)+u^3} = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty\\sum_{u=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+t)+u^3}\n\\]5. Combining both sums (and noting the identity $\\sum_{u=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(u+1)^3} = \\sum_{u=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{u^3} - 1$ and exchanging order of summation), we obtain:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2-(1/2)}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}-\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}\\right)\n\\]6. Substituting $p - q = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}-1)$ and noting that $q \\approx p + \\frac{1}{12} \\cdot p^2$:\\[\np - q \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3+k^3}-1\\right) \\approx q\n\\]7. Therefore, $p - q \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(p + \\frac{1}{12}(p^2-1))$, giving the final answer:Thus, the problem can be expressed in terms of  $p$, and  $q$ as follows:\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2}(p - q) + \\frac{1}{2q}p^2\n\\]Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{p - q}$.",
