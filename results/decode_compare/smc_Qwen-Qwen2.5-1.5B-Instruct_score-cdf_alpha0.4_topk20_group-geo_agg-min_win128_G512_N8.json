Step 1: Calculate the distance $r$.\n- Here, $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.Since the point $(0, 3)$ lies on the y-axis, it lies on the positive part of the angle axis. Thus, the angle $\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, because we are at the right most direction on the y-axis. Step 2: Calculate $\\theta$.\n- We know that $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$. \n- But as we know that $x = 0$, we have to take it into consideration that as part of the definition of arctangent it returns multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (sine or cosine of 45 degrees or 45pi/45 degree).Therefore, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.Thus, the polar coordinates are $(r, \\theta) = (3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.The final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",
