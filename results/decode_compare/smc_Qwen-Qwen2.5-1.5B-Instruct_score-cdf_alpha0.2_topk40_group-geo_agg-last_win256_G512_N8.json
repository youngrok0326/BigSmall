          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of the double sum as the expressions are finite to $k$ numbers. So now, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.3. To find a way to write this in terms of $p$ and $q$, we can use the fact that $\\frac{1}{j^3}$ can be expressed in terms of $p$ and $q$ as $\\frac{1}{j^3} = \\frac{1}{j^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{j} = \\frac{1}{j^2} \\cdot j^3$.4. So, substituting $\\frac{1}{j^3}$ from Step 3 into $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$, we get $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\frac{1}{j^3}}{(j+k)^3}$.5. Now, we can combine the sums as $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k+1)^3}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.6. Now, we compare this expression to the definition of $q$. Notice that $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2k)^3}= \\frac{1}{8}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} = \\frac{1}{8}q$.7. Now, we combine the sums into one sum, to see if we can express the expression in terms of $p$ and $q$. This is where we use the fact that $\\frac{1}{k^3}$ can be split into $\\frac{1}{k^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k}$.8. Substituting $\\frac{1}{k^2}$ from Step 5 into $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$, we get $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\frac{1}{j^2}}{(j+k)^3}$. 9. Collect all the $\\frac{1}{j^2}$s together, and use the fact that $u^3 = \\frac{u^2}{u}$ from Step 8 to get $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$10. By changing the order of the first sum to $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ from Step 9, we get the following equivalent expression for $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(k+1)^3}$.11. Now, by combining the first sum from Step 2 with the equivalent sum from Step 10, we get the final expression in terms of $p$ and $q$ by matching the indices.12. Thus, $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = pq$.13. The value of $p$ is $\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$, from which we get that $q = \\frac{\\pi^3}{9} \\approx 1.2301, p \\approx 1.6435$, and consequently $pq \\approx 1.9659$.14. Hence, the answer is $pq = \\boxed{1.9",
