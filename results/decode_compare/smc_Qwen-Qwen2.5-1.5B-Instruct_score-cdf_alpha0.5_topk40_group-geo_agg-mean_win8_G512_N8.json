We can use the term-by-term integration for calculating the infinite sum.\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{j = 1, \\, k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1, \\, k = 1}^\\infty \\int_{0}^{1} (t + j)^{-3} \\, dt \\\\\n\\end{align*}Step 2: To evaluate this integral, let's perform a change of variables using $t = j - x$:\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{1} (t + j)^{-3} \\, dt &= \\int_{0}^{1} (j + x)^{-3} \\, dx \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2(j + x)^2} \\bigg|_{0}^{1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2(j + 1)^2} - \\frac{1}{2(j + 1)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2(j + 1)^2}\n\\end{align*}It may seem odd that we ended up with $\\frac{1}{2}$, but note that we have not yet considered the fact that in our original expression coming from the initial sum, the term $j = k$ was being added twice (once inside the summation, and again when seen separately in the limit as a single function).Step 3: Therefore, we define our intermediate sum as:\\[ \\sum_{j = 1, \\, k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^2} \\]This simplifies to:\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^2} \\]Step 4: Firstly, lets define our final sum $ p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$. To complete the above expression in terms of $p$, we split the infinite sum into two parts:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^2} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{(2 j + 1)^2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}Using the distinction that $ p = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2}$:\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} p + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{(2 j + 1)^2}\\]Step 5: Furthermore, we define $ q = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2 j + 1)^2}$ to represent our intermediate term previously.Step 6: Substituting these terms together, we have:\\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + 1)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} p + \\frac{1}{2} q \\]Therefore, the original expression can be rewritten:\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} p + \\frac{1}{2} q}",
