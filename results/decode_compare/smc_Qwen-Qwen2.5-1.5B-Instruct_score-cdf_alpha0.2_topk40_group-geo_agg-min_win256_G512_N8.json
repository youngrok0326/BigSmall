For each $j$, consider the sum of $\\frac{1}{(j + k)^2}$ for all $k$ from 1 to infinity. This is a double sum, but we will focus on how it relates to $p$.Step 2: We can rewrite the double sum as a series over $j$.

We know that $p$ is the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of all integers, and $q$ is the sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of all integers.Step 7: Note that the sum of reciprocals of cubes is greater than the sum of reciprocals of squares. Therefore, the sum of reciprocals of cubes of all integers is greater than the sum of reciprocals of squares of all integers.Step 8: Therefore, we can write the sum of reciprocals of cubes of all integers as a sum of reciprocals of squares of all integers.Step 9: Therefore, we can write $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ as a sum over $j$, equal to $pq$.Therefore, the sum of reciprocals of cubes of all integers is $pq$.Therefore, the final answer is: $pq = \\boxed{pq}$.
