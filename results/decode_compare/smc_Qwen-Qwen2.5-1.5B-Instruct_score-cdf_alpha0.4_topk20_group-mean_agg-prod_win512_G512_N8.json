However, this can be simplified by considering the symmetry and properties of the sums \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).Notice that:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = p \\]\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} = q \\]We can use these sums to find a connection to our double sum.

Since \\(k\\) ranges from 1 to \\(\\infty\\), for each \\(j\\) we can count the pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k \\leq n\\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sums \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) can be related to our double sum through a known series representation.By a known result in complex analysis or series manipulation, the double sum can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{q}{2} + \\frac{p}{2} \\]Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\right) \\]Using the known values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), we replace them:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{q}{2} + \\frac{p}{2} \\right) \\]Simplifying further:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{q}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{q}{4} + \\frac{p}{4} \\]Therefore, the final expression in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is:\n\\[ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{p + q}{4} \\]So, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{p + q}{4}}\n\\]",
