However, in the context of polar coordinates, we can consider this to be equivalent to $\\arctan(\\infty)$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees) because as $x$ approaches 0, and $y$ approaches infinity, the angle between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point approaches 90 degrees.Therefore, the point $(0, 3)$ in rectangular coordinates, when converted to polar coordinates, can be represented as $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.The final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}$.",

Note that when $j + k = c$, $k$ can be written as $c - j$. Now, the inner circle becomes the double sum: $\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\frac{j+c}{(c-j)^3}$.3. Perform the outer circle ($j$) integration. In this case, when $j + k = c$, $j$ can be written as $c - k$. Now the outer circle becomes the sum: $\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{c-k}{(c-k)^3}$ or $\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{k+1}{(k+1)^3}$.4. Simplify the expressions by removing the denominators and the variable in the denominator of the fraction: $\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{k+1}$.5. Notice the arrangement of terms in the $k$ summation. It has terms of the form $\\frac{1}{1}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$... till $\\frac{1}{c-1}$, then back to the term $\\frac{1}{c}$ but not including it. This sequence corresponds to the series $p = \\sum_{k=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{k^2}$.6. Similarly, when integrating the expression with respect to $j$, the sequence of terms can also be written as the series $q = \\sum_{k=1}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{k^3}$.Therefore, we have \\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{c-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{c-j}\\frac{1}{(j+c-k)^3} = \\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\\frac{1}{k+1} = \\frac{p}{c}.\n\\]Since $c = p$, we can simplify this expression to be equal to:\\[\n\\frac{p}{p} = 1.\n\\]Thus, we conclude that the expression $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ evaluates to 1 in terms of $p$ and $q$.
