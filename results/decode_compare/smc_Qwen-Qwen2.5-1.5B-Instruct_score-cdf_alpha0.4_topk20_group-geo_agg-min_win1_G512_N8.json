Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We begin by manipulating the double sum $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$:   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j\\cdot k)^3}.\n   \\]   We combine the constants and interchange the order of summation:   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^3 k^3}.\n   \\]   This can be rewritten as:   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{j^3}\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}, \n   \\]   where we have used the fact that the double sum is equal to the sum of the series summed over $j$ then $k$.3. Simplifying further, we know that $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^3}$ is $q$.4. Thus, we have:   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} = \\frac{2}{p}.\n   \\]5. Therefore,   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{p} \\cdot \\frac{2}{q} = \\frac{2}{pq}.\n   \\]6. Substitute this into the definition of $c$ to obtain:   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{2c}{pq}.\n   \\]7. Hence, we find that our final expression for $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ is:   \\[\n   \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\frac{2c}{pq}.\n   \\]8. Finally, knowing that $c = p$, we substitute and get:   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{p}{c} \\cdot pq} = \\frac{2}{pq} + \\frac{c}{pq} = \\frac{2}{pq} + \\frac{p}{pq} = \\frac{3}{pq}.\n   \\]9.
