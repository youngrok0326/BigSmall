          "answer": "9",
          "completion": "## Step 1: Prime factorization of 196\nTo find the number of divisors, we'll first need to find the prime factorization of 196.196 can be factored into prime numbers as: $196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2$.## Step 2: Use the formula for divisor counting\nThe formula for determining the number of positive divisors is based on the exponents of the prime factors. For a number $n$ with the prime factorization $n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{a_k}$, the number of divisors is given by $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1)$.Since we only have two distinct prime factors (2 and 7), raising each to its respective power and then adding one to each power will give us the total number of divisors.- $2^{a_1} \\times 2^{a_2}$ becomes $(2^{a_1 + 1} \\times 2^{a_2 + 1})$.## Step 3: Calculate the total number of divisors\nNow, applying the formula, we have:\n- 2nd power of 2: $2^3 \\times 7^2$ becomes $(2^3 \\times 7^2 + 1)^{(a_1 + 1) \\times (a_2 + 1)}$.Simplifying the exponents and adding 1 to both sides gives us $(2^3 \\times 7^2 + 1)^{(a_1 + 1) \\times (a_2 + 1)}$.This simplifies to $(3^3 \\times 8^2 + 1)^{(2 \\times 3 + 1) \\times (2 \\times 1)}$, which further simplifies to $(27 \\times 64 + 1)^{8 \\times 3}$.Thus, the total number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is calculated to be $(20737 + 1)^{24}$.## Step 4: Final Calculation\nFinally, calculating the right side of the exponent, we get $20738^{24}$.Therefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is $20738^{24}$.There was an internal calculation error in the final step due to an assumption that simple arithmetic was being performed where actual exponent manipulation might've been more complex given the nature of the question.Wait, this is a bit misleading. Let's re-evaluate.The correct initial approach should have been to directly multiply $(2+1)(7+1)$ since every pair of factors from those will produce a unique divisor, not multiply an already calculated exponent.Given that,\n- $2^3 \\times 7^2$ is calculated initially, and then essentially $3 \\times 2$ yields 6, and $2 \\times 7$ yields 14, meaning the total number of divisors is straightforwardly calculated directly as $(14)(6)$ from prime factors exclusion, which indeed leads to the realization of the error in the interpretation rather than the solution.Given the mistake in the transition from individual primes to the exponents of each prime, let's directly solve for the divisor count using individual primes:For the prime 2, there are two 2's, so we have $3$ options.\nFor the prime 7, there are two 7's, so we have $3$ options.Therefore, the total number of divisors is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$.",
