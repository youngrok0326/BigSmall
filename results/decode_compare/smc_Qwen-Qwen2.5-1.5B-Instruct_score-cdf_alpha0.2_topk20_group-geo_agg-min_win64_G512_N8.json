          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of summation, and we can do this because the double sum in the outer part is finite because there will be no term with $k = j + 1$.3. Now let's interchange the order of summation to get $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$, so now we are summing over the terms in a ``column'' of different values.4. Now we can re-arrange the terms by changing the indices. Since we changed $k$ with $j + 1$ we also make $k$ the index and change $j$ with $k$. We get $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(k+1)^3}$. 5. If we change $k$ with $j + 1$ we get $\\frac{1}{(k + 1)^3} = \\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}$. 6. Subtract from this $\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}$ from the first term and from the second term $\\frac{1}{j^3}$, we get $p - \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3} = q$.7. Reorganize the terms to rearrange the terms by changing $k$ to $j + 1$ we get $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}$. 8. Now we change $k$ with $j + 1$ and we get $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}$.9. Now the previous expression becomes $q - \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}$.10. If we divide both the numerator and denominator of the sum by $2$, we get $\\frac{q - \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}}{2}$.11. Now we can take the total sum of of $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ as the sum of the terms $1$ for each term $(j + k)$ and since we have $k$ going from $1$ to infinity, and we have $j$ going from $1$ to infinity, the sum of the terms is again $\\infty$.12. If we let $k$ and $n$ go from $1$ to infinity, we get $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(jn)^N}$. 13. If we interchange the order of summation, we get $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(jn)^N}$.14. Now we can transform our index to $j$ we get $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^n(Nn)} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^{N}}$.15. If we let $N = 2$, then the above equation becomes $p$, which is $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^{N}}$.16. If we interchange the order of summation, we get $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(jn)^2} = q$, which is $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^{N}}$.Final Answer: $\\sum",
