          "answer": "p - q",
          "completion": "1. Let's start by defining $c = p$. Thus, we have $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$. 2. We can interchange the order of the double sum as the expressions are finite to $k$ numbers. So now, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.3. We can apply the same approach by letting $c = q$, so we have $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.4. At this point, the expression on the right-hand side can be re-written as $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2(k + j)}$.5. Notice that by adding 1 to each term of the multipliers in the inner sum, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^2}$. 6. Therefore, we can express the original equation in terms of two other series as $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(1 + j)^3} + \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3}$.7. These two series are with respect to three variables $k, j$ where one of the variables is $k$ and the other is $j$, and therefore, they are not in the same series.8. Therefore, the overall solution is $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{j^2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(1+j)^3}$. 9. Thus, we get $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2} = p$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(1+j)^3} = p$.10. Therefore, we get $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(1+j)^3} = \\frac{1}{p}$. 11. And finally, we get $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(1+j)^3} = p + \\frac{1}{p}$.12. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{p + \\frac{1}{p}}$.",
