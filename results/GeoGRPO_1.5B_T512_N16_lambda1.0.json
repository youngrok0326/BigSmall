Poklova would make a profit of E = $260,000 = $260,000.\n2 <answer>\n260000\n</answer>\nSolution: Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then added $50,000 for repairs, so the initial purchase price was 80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000. He got 150% increase from this price, so the value of the house increased by 130,000*1.5 = $260,000. This means that the total price of the house is now 130,000 + 260,000 = $390,000.

She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\nSolution: ",
                    "answer": "20",
                    "completion": " Let's think through this problem step by step:\n\n1. First, let's find out how much feed Wendi gives her flock each day. She gives them three meals of feed, and each meal is 15 + 25 cups. Therefore, the total amount of feed per day is (15 + 25) \u00d7 3 cups = 240 cups.\n\n2. Next, let's find out how much feed each chicken receives every day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we can divide the total amount of feed per day by the number of chickens. Therefore, each chicken receives (240 cups / 20 chickens) = 12 cups of feed per day.\n\n3. Now, let's consider how much feed each chicken receives in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, Wendi gives each chicken 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives each chicken 25 cups of feed. So, each chicken receives a total of (15 + 25) cups of feed per day = 40 cups.\n\n4. Since each chicken receives 40 cups of feed per day and there are 20 chickens, we can multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day to find out how much feed Wendi needs to give to her entire flock. This would be (20 chickens) \u00d7 (40 cups) = 800 cups.\n\n5. Finally, to find out how much more feed Wendi needs to give her flock at the end of the day, we subtract the amount of feed she has already given (15 + 25 cups) from the total amount of feed she needs to give her flock (800 cups). This would be (800 cups) - (15 + 25) cups = 760 cups.\n\nAnswer: Wendi needs to give her flock of 20 chickens a total of 760 extra cups of feed at the end of the day.",
