If the store sells 4 headphones and 2 sockets for $82.4, what is the difference between the unit price of a socket and a headphone?\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. We have a system of linear equations. Let's denote the unit price of a headphone as \\( h \\) and the unit price of a socket as \\( s \\).\n\n2. The first transaction gives us: \\( 2h + 3s = 59.8 \\).\n\n3. The second transaction gives us: \\( 4h + 2s = 82.4 \\).\n\n4. We want to find the difference between the unit price of a socket and a headphone, which is \\( s - h \\).\n\n5. We can solve this system of equations to find \\( h \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n6. First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing by 2: \\( 2h + s = 41.2 \\).\n\n7. Now we have the following system: \\( 2h + 3s = 59.8 \\) and \\( 2h + s = 41.2 \\).\n\n8. Subtract the second equation from the first: \\( (2h + 3s) - (2h + s) = 59.8 - 41.2 \\).\n\n9. This simplifies to \\( 2s = 18.6 \\), so \\( s = 9.3 \\).\n\n10. Substitute \\( s = 9.3 \\) back into the second equation: \\( 2h + 9.3 = 41.2 \\).\n\n11. Solve",
