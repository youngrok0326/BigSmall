We can find $q$ by evaluating the infinite series $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.$\n4. However, we need to find a way to write $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ in terms of $p$ and $q.$\n5. We can use the fact that $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = p$ and $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} = q.$\n6. We can rewrite $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ as $\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3} \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.$\n7.

First, let's start with the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethane:\n\n    ethane (C2H6) + oxygen (O2) -> carbon dioxide (CO2) + water (H2O)\n\n2. Now, we know that the combustion of ethane requires three times the number of moles of oxygen as the number of moles of ethane. Therefore, we will first calculate the moles of oxygen required for the complete combustion of 0.2 moles of ethane:\n\n    moles of oxygen = 3 * moles of ethane\n    moles of oxygen = 3 * 0.2 moles\n    moles of oxygen = 0.6 moles\n\n3. Now, we know that the combustion of ethane produces carbon dioxide and water. To find the number of moles of carbon dioxide formed, we will use the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation:\n\n    moles of CO2 = moles of ethane * (2 moles of CO2 / 1 mole of ethane)\n    moles of CO2 = 0.2 moles * (2 moles)\n    moles of CO2 = 0.4 moles\n\n4.

Let's call the distance $r$ and the angle $\\theta$. To find $r$, we can use the distance formula to find the distance between the origin and the point $(0,3)$. The distance formula is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. Plugging in the values, we get $\\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2} = 3$. So $r = 3$. To find $\\theta$, we need to find the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin and the point. We can do this by finding the angle between the line connecting the origin and the point and the negative x-axis. The angle between two lines is equal to the sum of the angles formed by each line with the positive x-axis. The line connecting the origin and the point has an angle of $0$ degrees with the positive x-axis, while the negative x-axis has an angle of $180$ degrees with the positive x-axis. So the angle between the line connecting the origin and the point and the negative x-axis is $0 + 180 = 180$ degrees.

The area of a rhombus can be found using the formula: Area = (diagonal1 * diagonal2) / 2, where diagonal1 and diagonal2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n2. We are given that the lengths of the diagonals are 16 and 30.\n3. Substituting the values into the formula, we get: Area = (16 * 30) / 2\n4. Simplifying the expression, we get: Area = 480 /",

Dividing 49 by 7 gives 7, and 7 divided by 7 gives 1. So, the prime factorization of 196 is 2^2 * 7^2. To find the number of divisors, I add 1 to each exponent and multiply the results.

The radius $r$ can be found by the formula $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ Substituting in, we get $r = \\sqrt{0^2+3^2} = 3.$ The polar angle follows from the formula $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\dfrac{y}{x}.$ However, there are a couple of tricks here!  First, the $x$-coordinate cannot be 0, and second, the point cannot be in the third or fourth quadrant, both of which can happen if we simply take arctan of the slope.  Instead, we have to take into account the signs of $x$ and $y$ in order to be able to get the arctan us in the correct quadrant.  Let's compute.  We have $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\frac{3}{0}.$  However, the value of the tangent does not end up determining $\\theta$, as the point is on one of the axes!  Therefore, in order to find $\\theta$, we look at the direction of the point from the origin.  The point is in the second quadrant, so the angle is just $\\frac{3}{0},$ which gives $\\theta = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}.$ Therefore, the point in polar coordinates is $(3,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}).$",

Count the number of factors.\nHere's how we can think about this reasoning process:\n1. We know that 196 is a number, and we can check if it is prime or not. If it is not prime, we can find its factors.\n2. We can use prime factorization to find the factors of 196. 196 = 2^2 * 7^2, so the factors are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98, 196.\n3.

Since 14 is a whole number, it is already a divisor. Count 1 (the first divisor), 14 (the second divisor), and then pair them to include all other divisors. Therefore, there are 14 divisors in total.\n\n**Correct Answer**: 14",

I know that 196 is even, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. I notice that 98 is also even, so I divide it by 2 to get 49. 49 is not divisible by 2, so I try the next prime number, 3. It doesn't work either, so I move on to 5. 49 is not divisible by 5, so I try the next prime number, 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives me 7. Now I have the prime factorization of 196, which is 2^2 * 7^2. The number of divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each exponent in its prime factorization and multiplying the results together. So, the number of divisors of 196 is (2+1)(2+1) = 9.

The polar coordinates are $(r,\\theta)$ where $r$ is the distance from the origin and $\\theta$ is the angle counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. For the point $(0,3)$, $r$ is the distance along the y-axis, which is 3, so $r = 3$. The angle $\\theta$ is simply $\\pi/2$ (or 90 degrees), because the point is directly above the origin along the y-axis.
