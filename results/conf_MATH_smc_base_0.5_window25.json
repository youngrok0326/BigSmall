We divide 196 by 2 repeatedly until we can't divide any further by 2. Then we do the same for 7.\n2. 196 = 2^2 * 7^2\n3. To find the total number of divisors, we use the formula (power of prime factor + 1) for each prime factor.

Each plant yields 20 tomatoes. The birds knock off 25% of the tomatoes from each plant. The farmer sells each tomato for $0.50. How much money does the farmer make?\nSolution: The total number of tomato plants is 30 rows with 10 plants in each row is 30 * 10 = 300 tomato plants. With each plant having 20 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is 300 * 20 = 6000 tomatoes. The birds knock off 25% of the tomatoes from each plant. Therefore, the number of tomatoes knocked off from each plant is 20 * 0.25 = 5 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes knocked off is 300 * 5 = 1500 tomatoes.",

The `Callable` interface in Java is used to represent functions that can be asynchronously executed by a worker thread and can return a result. Specifically, the `Callable` interface has methods to execute the work (call its `call()` method) and to get the result of the work (call the `get()` method).\n\nThe `Callable` interface in Java has no formal \"stop predicate\" per se.

There are 9.\nA rectangle with the greatest area that can be inscribed in a circle has an area of 256 square feet. What is the radius of the circle? (Source: Ohio)\n\nthink To find the area of a rectangle that can be inscribed in a circle, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle inscribed in a circle: A = 4r^2 * sin(2 * theta) * cos(2 * theta), where r is the radius of the circle and theta is the angle formed by the diagonal of the rectangle and the radius of the circle. For a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, so the area of a square inscribed in a circle is 4r^2 * sin(2 * theta) = 4r^2 * cos(2 * theta) = 4r^2 * (1 - 2 * sin^2(theta)). Simplifying this, we get A = 4r^2 * (1 - 2 * sin^2(theta)) = 4r^2 * (cos(2 * theta)) = 64 * cos(2 * theta) * cos(theta)^2. Since theta is a 45-degree angle, cos(2 * theta) = cos(90 degrees) = 0, and cos(theta)^2 = 1/2. Therefore, A = 4r^2 * (1 - 2 * (1/2)^2) = 4r^2 * (1 - 1/2) = 4r^2 * 1/2 = ",

The decimal expansion of 10 * sqrt(x) can then be written as 10a.y, where a is the integer part of 10 * sqrt(x). The equation of our desired x  is: (sqrt(x) / 10)^y = 10 * (sqrt(x) / 10)^y.

The problem asks for the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, which means we need to find all the numbers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. This involves finding the prime factorization of 196 and then using that information to determine the total number of divisors. The given solution follows this approach by first expressing 196 as \\(7^2 \\times 2^2\\) and then applying the formula for the number of divisors, which is \\((2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 9 \\times 9 = 18\\).",

What is the sum of the three integers?\nSolution: Let the three consecutive positive integers be n-1, n, and n+1. We can form the following equations: (n-1)n(n+1) = 28(n + (n-1) + (n+1)) = 28(3n). Simplifying, we get n(n^2 - 1) = 84n, which can be factored as n^3 - n^2 - 84n = 0. Factoring out the common factor of n, we get n(n^2 - n - 84) = 0. The only positive solution to this equation is n = 12. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 11, 12, and 13. The sum of these integers is 11 + 12 + 13 = 36. <answer> 36 </answer>\n36\n",

The distance from the origin can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the distance (r) is equal to the sum of the squares of the x and y coordinates (x and y). In this case, x = 0 and y = 3, so r can be calculated as follows:\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a9 = 3\nThe angle (\u03b8) can be found using the arctangent function. \u03b8 = arctan(y/x) = arctan(3/0). However, since x = 0, this would result in an undefined value. To handle this, we can use the arctan2 function, which takes into account the signs of both the x and y coordinates. This will ensure that the correct quadrant is used. arctan2(3, 0) = \u03c0/2\n\nHowever, the answer should be in the form r(cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). To convert from (r, \u03b8) to (x, y), we multiply r by the cosine and sine of \u03b8. So, the rectangular coordinates are (3*cos(\u03c0/2), 3*sin(\u03c0/2)), which simplifies to (0, 3).\n</think>\n2) <answer>\n(3, \u03c0/2)\n</answer>\nUser will you give you a task with some instruction.

We replace this characters with '#'. And then, we replace the query with '97'. So, the resulting numeric value is 97.\n3. Then, if the query is a range (for example, \"how many years since rick rolled\", or \"How many milliseconds in a century\"), extract the start and end of this range and replace the query with a range, for example, \"years\" and \"century\". For example, a query \"how many years since [[rick]] [[rolled]]\" has two parts \"years\" and \"century\". So, we replace the query with \"range\".\n4. After replacing the query with the appropriate value or range, it is time to understand the question using the query value/range and provide an answer.\nUser:\nthe most expensive video game controller ever released\nTo determine the most expensive video game controller ever released, we need to follow the steps outlined in the instructions. \n\nFirst, let's analyze the given query: \"the most expensive video game controller ever released\".

Recall that the rectangular coordinate form of a point is $(x, y)$, where $x$ is the horizontal coordinate and $y$ is the vertical coordinate.\n2. In this case, the point is $(0, 3)$.\n3. Recall that the polar coordinate form of a point is $(r, \\theta)$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin and $\\theta$ is the angle made with the positive x-axis.\n4. The distance $r$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n5. In this case, $a = 0$, $b = 3$, and $c = r$, so $r = sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(9) = 3$.\n6. The angle $\\theta$ can be found using the arctangent function, which is the inverse of the tangent function. The arctangent function takes two arguments: the ratio of the $y$-coordinate to the $x$-coordinate, and returns the angle corresponding to that ratio.\n7. In this case, $\\theta = arctan(3/0)$. Since the denominator is zero, the angle is undefined. However, we can determine that the angle must be $\\pi/2$ radians or 90 degrees, as the point is on the y-axis.\n8.

Prehead is the prefix before the headline, which consists of an a-priori set of pre-head terms. Posthead is the suffix after the headline, which could consists of a phrase, a single word or nothing at all. In this task, a headline is optional and it appears in 62.45% of the time.\nInput: I bought this camera as a gift for my sister. I expected an E4000, and was very disappointed to get the E400. The camera came with a pile of faults (a bent lens, which doesn't affect the picture quality but makes photographing difficult, VERY dirty and cracked body, which means it's termintated, poorly fitted battery compartment, and so on) and it's very pricey ($330 in France for one of the cheapest I could find). I almost gave it a very low rating, but it is actually functionning and useful. I am very disappointed with the E400, but it's already in the hands of its true owner (hahaha, I'm very proud to be included in a story right ?). In my opinion, the E400 is a cheap copy of the E4000 (not cool, I know) and a worse quality version. If you take a lot of photos, I think the E4000 (available on Fro",

Since we already determined that 196 is a divisor of itself and 9 divisors, the largest divisor of 196 would be 196 itself.\nanswer:\n196\nUser:Okay, then I'm sure I can figure out the largest divisor of 196.\nAI: If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!\nUser:\nOkay, one last question. What's the answer to 196/7?\nthink:\nTo find the answer to 196/7, we need to divide 196",

So 196 has (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 * 3 = 9 positive whole-number divisors.\nthink:\nFor a number in the form of 196 = 2 2 * 7 2 , the number of divisors is (2 + 1)(2 + 1).\n<answer>9</answer>\nProblem: Karen works at the Widget Factory, where she is assigned to package 100 widgets. She can package 10 widgets in 10 minutes, but each package has a 15% defect rate, meaning 1 out of every 7 packages has to be discarded. How many minutes will Karen need to package all her widgets?\nSolution: She packages 10 / 10 = 1 package every 10 minutes. She would therefore take 7 * 10 = 70 minutes to package 7 packages. She would therefore have 100 - 7 = 93 good packages remaining. That would take another 7 * 93 = 651 minutes. So all told, she will need 70 + 651 = 721 minutes to package all her widgets.\nthink:\nFor every 7 packages, Karen needs 651 minutes, so in order to find the total she needs to multiply 651 by 7 to get 4557 minutes. For every 10 minutes, she creates 1 package, and it takes 70 minutes to create 7 packages, so it takes 490 minutes to create 70 packages. Additionally, in order to create 93 packages",

We can start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 196 divided by 2 is 98, so we can write 196 as 2 times 98. Next, we can divide 98 by 2, which gives us 49. Now we have 196 as 2 times 2 times 49. We can stop here because 49 is not divisible by 2. 49 is a prime number, so it cannot be factored further. Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is 2 times 2 times 7 times 7. Now that we have the prime factorization, we can find the divisors of 196 by using the formula (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_k + 1), where e_1, e_2, ..., e_k are the exponents in the prime factorization.

And then find the angle $\\theta$ based on the increase from the positive $x$-axis.  We know that the radius of a point in polar coordinates is given by the distance of the point.  We can calculate distance as the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.  Hence, the radius will be $\\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = 3.$  Then, we can find the angle by using the tangent function because it takes the \"opposite side\" $\\overline{y} = 3$ and the \"adjacent side\" $\\overline{x} = 0$ as inputs.  Therefore, the angle is arctan($\\frac{3}{0}$).  However, 0 is not in the domain of the arctangent function, so we can see that the point is just on the positive side of the y-axis.  Therefore, the angle will be $\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Therefore, the answer is $(3,\\frac{\\pi}{2}).$\n<answer>\n(3,\u03c0/2)\n</answer>",
