We can use Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the square root of the sum of the squares of the legs gives the square of the hypotenuse. So we have:$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$Now we know:$r = 3$So now we can find the angle $\\theta$ by using the arctangent function, also known as inverse tangent, because the tangent of an angle is equal to the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate:$\\theta = \\tan^{-1} (3/0) = \\pi/2$However, we need to account for the quadrant where the angle is located, so we have to use a negative value of pi (since the angle is measured from the positive x-axis clockwise):$\\theta = -\\pi/2$To convert this angle to polar coordinates, we use the following formulas:$r = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot r_{\\text{new}} \\cdot \\cos(\\theta_{\\text{old}} - \\pi/2)$and$\\theta_{\\text{new}} = \\theta_{\\text{old}} + \\pi$where $r_{\\text{new}}$ and $\\theta_{\\text{new}}$ are the new values of r and $\\theta_{\\text{new}}$, respectively. To find $r_{\\text{new}}$, we take the square of the distance, pi, and multiply it by 2:$r_{\\text{new}} = (3 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 2 = 6\\sqrt{2}$and to find $\\theta_{\\text{new}}$, we take the square of the distance, pi, subtract it from pi (as applied to angle measurement), and then add pi to it:$\\theta_{\\text{new}} = \\pi + \\pi = 2\\pi$Therefore, the polar coordinates of $(0,3)$ are $(6\\sqrt{2}, -\\pi/2)$.If you want to write it as a fraction, the expression would be:$r = 3\\sqrt{2}$and$\\",

To simplify the second term into a finite limit, we can use the fact that:$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k + k^{-1}} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{k - 1}{k(1 + k^{-1}) - k} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{k - 1}{k(k - 1)/k + 1/k} = 1,$$since 1/1 grows without bound. Therefore, the sum approaches infinite, and we can write:$$\\",
