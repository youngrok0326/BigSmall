She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\n\nSolution:\n\n## Step 1:",

                    "completion": " Determine the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast.\n\nJanet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. Therefore, for simplicity, we assume she eats 3 eggs per day for breakfast. This step involves calculating the number of eggs she consumes for breakfast.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs left after breakfast.\n\nJanet has 16 eggs per day, eating 3 for breakfast. So, the number of eggs left is 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. This step involves performing the subtraction to find out how many eggs are left after breakfast.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market.\n\nJanet bakes muffins for her friends with 4 eggs. Since she has 13 eggs left but only uses 4 for muffins, she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left to sell. This step involves performing the subtraction to find out how many eggs are left after making muffins for friends.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the revenue from selling the eggs at the farmers' market.\n\nShe sells her remaining eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, the revenue is 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18 per day. This step involves calculating the revenue by multiplying the number of eggs sold by the price per egg.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$.",
