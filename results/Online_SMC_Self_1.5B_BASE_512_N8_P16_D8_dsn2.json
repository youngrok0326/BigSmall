How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\n\nSolution:\n\n## Step 1:",
                    "answer": "20",
                    "completion": " Determine the total amount of feed provided to the flock.\nWendi feeds her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed currently given to the flock is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed needed for all the chickens.\nSince Wendi has 20 chickens, she needs to provide 40 cups of feed, one of which is already accounted for in the morning and the afternoon. Thus, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is the remaining cups after subtracting the feed already given. That is, 40 cups - 15 cups - 25 cups = 10 cups.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the composition and distribution of the feed.\nThe feed should contain seeds, mealworms, and vegetables. However, the exact composition is not specified in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot determine the volume or proportion of each component in the feed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$.",

So, the total amount of feed given to the chickens is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the amount of feed left after the morning and afternoon meals.\nSince the flock has 20 chickens, each chicken gets 40 / 20 = 2 cups of feed. The total amount of feed given to the chickens is 40 cups, and the total feed available is 60 cups (15 + 25).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal.\nIf the total amount of feed given to the chickens is 40 cups, and the total feed available is 60 cups, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is 60 - 40 = 20 cups.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$.",
