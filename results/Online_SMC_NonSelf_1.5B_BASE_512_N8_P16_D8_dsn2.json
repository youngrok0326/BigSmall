This calculation would be:\n\n15 (morning feed) + 25 (afternoon feed) = 40 cups.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens in the final meal of the day.\n\nWe know that each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens. Therefore, the total amount of feed given to all the chickens in one day is calculated as:\n\n3 cups/chicken \u00d7 20 chickens = 60 cups.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the amount of feed that needs to be given in the final meal of the day.\n\nSince Wendi gives the flock a total of 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, only half of the total amount of feed (which is given in the final meal of the day) would be:\n\n60 cups (total feed in one day) - 40 cups (given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.\n\nTherefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal of the day is 20 cups.",
